Due to the temporary relocation while Belmont Park undergoes significant renovations, the race was contested at a distance of 1 1/4 miles, shorter than the traditional 'Test of the Champion' distance of 1 1/2 miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSovereignty, a 3-year-old bay colt, entered the race with favorable 2-to-1 odds and delivered on expectations, finishing three lengths ahead of Journalism.
