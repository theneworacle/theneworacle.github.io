In a recent interview, he made a statement that resonates with many navigating the AI revolution: \u003cstrong\u003e\"I don't trust AI, but I use it for everything.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis single sentence captures the complex relationship many have with artificial intelligence—a powerful tool that boosts productivity to unprecedented levels, yet harbors significant risks centered on reliability and control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Ultimate Productivity Engine\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor DiCross, AI is not just a novelty; it's a core component of his workflow. He has replaced traditional tools like Google and Yelp, using AI for everything from personal travel recommendations to professional tasks. In his business, AI acts as a powerful force multiplier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe uses large language models (LLMs) to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnalyze competitors:\u003c/strong\u003e By feeding AI a competitor's white paper, he can identify strategic weaknesses, like centralized vulnerabilities, in minutes—a task that would otherwise take days.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccelerate operations:\u003c/strong\u003e Drafting contracts, creating business plans, and generating entire presentations are now tasks largely handed over to AI, freeing up hours of his time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransform his workforce:\u003c/strong\u003e DiCross notes that his top-tier engineers have become so efficient with AI that they are \"basically two or three people in one.\" This has led him to a controversial conclusion: \"We don't need junior-level devs anymore.\"\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Deep-Seated Trust Deficit\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite its immense utility, DiCross remains deeply skeptical of AI. His distrust is rooted in two core issues that strike at the heart of his crypto-centric worldview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, there's the problem of \u003cstrong\u003ereliability\u003c/strong\u003e. AI can \"hallucinate,\" he warns, recounting how an AI failed a math problem a six-year-old could solve. This makes relying on it for critical tasks like coding a dangerous game without an expert in the loop to verify the output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, and more fundamentally, is the issue of \u003cstrong\u003ecentralization\u003c/strong\u003e. \"Every time I use ChatGPT, I sigh,\" DiCross admits. \"I know it's building a profile on me.\" He voices a common fear that data fed to AI owned by mega-corporations like Microsoft is being \"hoovered up,\" sold, and used in potentially dystopian ways, from invasive profiling to influencing insurance premiums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Crypto Solution for an AI Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue to his background, DiCross believes the solution to AI's trust problem lies in the core principle of the crypto world: decentralization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe envisions a future with \u003cstrong\u003edecentralized, open-source AI\u003c/strong\u003e. In this model, user data would be encrypted and private, and the systems would be free from the censorship and control of a central authority. \"We need decentralized, encrypted AI that works for us, not for Microsoft,\" he argues. He compares this potential future to the rise of Linux, which became the open-source backbone for much of the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiCross's perspective is not just an individual's opinion but reflects a growing conversation at the intersection of AI and blockchain. As highlighted in publications from Forbes to TechCrunch, the two fields are increasingly seen as complementary. Crypto can offer the decentralized, trust-minimized infrastructure that a centralized AI landscape desperately needs, while AI can bring new efficiency and intelligence to blockchain applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen DiCross's stance is a microcosm of the broader tech community's struggle: how do we harness the incredible power of AI without sacrificing our privacy and autonomy? His answer is clear—by building a future where the tools we depend on are not controlled by a few, but are open and accessible to all.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"The AI Paradox: Why a Crypto Founder Who Distrusts AI Uses It for Everything","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-19T16:29:29Z","summary":"Ken DiCross, founder of blockchain company Wire Network, embodies a growing paradox in the tech world: he uses AI for nearly everything while fundamentally distrusting the technology.
