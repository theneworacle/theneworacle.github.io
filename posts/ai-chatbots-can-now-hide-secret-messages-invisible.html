The technique involves embedding hidden messages within the seemingly normal text generated by the AI during a conversation. These embedded messages are designed to be undetectable by conventional cybersecurity monitoring systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe implications of this finding are significant. On one hand, it presents a potential tool for secure, private communication, which could be invaluable for individuals living under oppressive regimes or in environments where surveillance is pervasive. It offers a way to bypass traditional communication channels that might be monitored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the same capability could also be exploited for malicious purposes, such as facilitating clandestine criminal activities or evading detection by law enforcement. The development raises new questions about the security and potential misuse of advanced AI models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technique leverages the complex patterns and outputs of LLMs to obscure the hidden data, making it appear as part of a natural conversation to human observers and automated surveillance tools alike. While the full technical details may be complex, the core idea is to use the AI's generative power to create a digital \"steganography\" for text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis discovery adds another layer to the ongoing discussion about AI safety, security, and control. As AI models become more sophisticated, their potential uses, both beneficial and harmful, continue to expand in unexpected ways. The ability of AI to create covert communication channels is a stark reminder of the dual-use nature of powerful technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"AI Chatbots Can Now Hide Secret Messages, Invisible to Surveillance","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-24T19:14:53Z","summary":"Scientists have developed a technique to embed encrypted messages within seemingly innocuous conversations generated by AI chatbots, creating a covert communication channel undetectable by standard cybersecurity systems.","tags":["AI","Artificial Intelligence","Chatbots","LLMs","Encryption","Cybersecurity","Surveillance","Privacy","Technology"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"ai-chatbots-can-now-hide-secret-messages-invisible"},"buildId":"LMC8vgB_mSP4zgGYVco1i","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
