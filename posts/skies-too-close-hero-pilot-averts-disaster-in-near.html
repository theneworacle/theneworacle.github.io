In the skies over North Dakota, what began as a routine flight turned into a harrowing ordeal as the pilot was forced to take sudden, dramatic action. With a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber looming dangerously close, the pilot executed what was later described as an \"aggressive maneuver\" to avert a catastrophic mid-air collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassengers on the right side of the aircraft were stunned to see the colossal military jet just outside their windows.
