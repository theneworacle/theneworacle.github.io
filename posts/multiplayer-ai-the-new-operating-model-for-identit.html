Identity-related breaches are not only costly, averaging $4.45 million per incident, but also account for a staggering 70% of successful attacks on enterprise infrastructure and supply chains. Despite significant investments in security technologies, breaches continue to make headlines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis presents what some call the identity security paradox: simply adding more technology doesn't guarantee protection if those tools, and the human and AI agents using them, cannot work together effectively. Identity has become the primary attack surface, and the rapid proliferation of cloud apps, machine identities, and AI agents has outpaced traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM), Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), and Privileged Access Management (PAM) controls. The result is siloed data, unmanaged accounts, and hidden nonhuman identities, each a potential vector for attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGartner reports that 65% of organizations still lack IAM maturity, burdened by technical debt and fragmented architectures. Point solutions deployed to address compliance gaps often add complexity rather than reduce it. Attackers expertly exploit these seams, moving laterally through systems and identities that are not monitored holistically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lesson is clear: isolated efforts, whether from a single expert, a standalone AI agent, or a disconnected tool, cannot keep pace with adversaries who are increasingly agile, automated, and collaborative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo close these critical gaps, interoperability must become the standard, not just for tools but for the people and AI agents utilizing them. This goes beyond merely connecting dashboards; it requires Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) and Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) systems to share data, context, and workflows in real-time across both human and machine identities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA \"system of systems\" approach, built on identity fabric principles, is recommended to support zero trust and intelligent automation. This means dismantling technical and organizational silos so that prevention and detection teams can operate from a unified, continuously updated single source of truth for identity data. This authoritative data layer enables faster, more accurate decisions, ensuring every team acts on the same intelligence. When ISPM and ITDR interoperate, and when human and AI teammates collaborate based on shared reference points, blind spots diminish, leaving attackers fewer seams to exploit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis evolution is leading to what's being called \"multiplayer AI\" – intelligent systems designed to amplify human capabilities through enhanced teamwork. By 2027, Gartner predicts that 90% of successful AI implementations in cybersecurity will focus on tactical task automation and process augmentation, not full autonomy or staff replacement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMultiplayer AI fosters collaboration between humans and AI, bridging gaps between prevention and detection. AI excels at analyzing vast datasets, identifying patterns humans might miss, and automating repetitive tasks. However, critical decisions, such as distinguishing between genuine threats and false positives, still require human judgment and contextual understanding. Studies show that organizations using collaborative AI models, where human decisions are informed by AI recommendations, experience faster response times, fewer security incidents, and improved resilience. The key is teamwork: AI handles data processing, while humans provide creativity, ethical oversight, and business context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, the industry is adapting quickly. The rise of agentic AI and the development of open standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A) are enabling AI agents from different vendors, clouds, and frameworks to communicate, share context, and coordinate tasks securely. Technology leaders like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are adopting these protocols, breaking down silos that have limited automation's impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor business leaders, agentic AI means specialized agents for threat detection, access management, compliance, and user behavior analytics can form ad hoc teams, automating complex workflows and adapting to new threats. By 2028, multiagent AI is forecasted to account for 70% of threat detection and response implementations, primarily to augment staff. Early adopters are expected to see measurable results, with agent-to-agent collaboration potentially cutting attacker dwell time by up to 50% and accelerating response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo build this resilient, multiplayer AI identity security model, leaders can implement several strategies:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEstablish an interoperability baseline:\u003c/strong\u003e Audit your existing tools for data sharing and workflow integration across human and machine identities. Ensure your architecture supports agent-to-agent interoperability using open standards.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePilot tactical AI augmentation:\u003c/strong\u003e Start with focused use cases, such as automated privilege review or anomaly detection, and track improvements.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuild AI literacy and human oversight:\u003c/strong\u003e Train teams on AI's capabilities and limitations, emphasizing where human verification is essential.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContinuously review identity hygiene:\u003c/strong\u003e Use AI-driven discovery to identify risky accounts, but require human validation before implementing changes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeasure what matters:\u003c/strong\u003e Focus on outcome-driven metrics like reducing excessive permissions, increasing MFA deployment, and decreasing incident response times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next major breach will likely not be stopped by a single new tool or a lone AI agent. Organizations that achieve true interoperability across tools, teams, and AI will be best positioned to respond accurately and effectively to security incidents. Multiplayer AI and agent-to-agent collaboration are becoming essential blueprints for resilience in the age of AI-driven turbulence. By assessing your current environment, unifying your tools and teams, and empowering your people with AI that amplifies their expertise, you can gain a crucial advantage in the high-stakes game of identity security.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Multiplayer AI: The New Operating Model For Identity Security","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-18T12:46:09Z","summary":"Traditional identity security methods are failing against sophisticated AI-driven cyberattacks.
