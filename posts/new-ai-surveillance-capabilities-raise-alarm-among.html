This development, first highlighted by Forbes, is ringing alarm bells among privacy advocates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlock Safety, known primarily for its extensive network of smart license plate readers, already boasts tens of thousands of cameras installed across communities. The upcoming update will reportedly enable police to request live feeds or clips from the time a vehicle passes through a camera's view, a feature Flock Safety CEO Garrett Langley suggests will enhance \"situational awareness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, civil liberties experts have long voiced concerns about the company's growing reach. Jay Stanley, technology director at the ACLU, expressed worries to Forbes that Flock \"is trying to build a nationwide authoritarian surveillance system.\" Critics argue that the expansion from tracking vehicles by license plate to providing broader video surveillance erodes the expectation of privacy in public spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trend of expanding AI surveillance isn't limited to Flock Safety. News reports indicate that similar debates are occurring in cities like Milwaukee and states like Texas regarding the increased use of AI-powered surveillance technologies, including license plate readers and broader camera systems. Furthermore, it appears private companies, such as FedEx and various retailers, are already sharing AI camera feeds with law enforcement, indicating a growing integration of private surveillance networks with public policing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the rising privacy concerns and ongoing public debate, investment in this technology remains robust. Flock Safety recently secured significant funding, pushing its valuation to $7.5 billion, underscoring the strong market confidence and continued adoption of these surveillance tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe public response to AI surveillance and its privacy implications appears mixed, with social sentiment analysis revealing a landscape of debate. While some may see these technologies as necessary for public safety and crime prevention, others are deeply concerned about the potential for misuse, mass surveillance, and the chilling effect on civil liberties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs AI surveillance capabilities continue to advance and integrate into both public and private infrastructure, the tension between security benefits and privacy rights is set to intensify, prompting urgent calls for clearer regulations and safeguards.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"New AI Surveillance Capabilities Raise Alarm Among Privacy Advocates","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-05T12:43:59Z","summary":"AI surveillance company Flock Safety is expanding its technology beyond license plate readers into broader surveillance, allowing police access to live camera feeds and historical footage.
