This move signals a new era for the FDA, aiming to leverage AI to streamline operations and improve efficiency across the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElsa is designed to be a powerful assistant for FDA staff, tackling a variety of tasks that are often time-consuming.

They highlight Elsa's potential to dramatically reduce the time required for tasks that previously took days, thereby freeing up valuable time for scientists and reviewers to focus on more critical analysis and evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity and data privacy were key considerations in Elsa's development.
