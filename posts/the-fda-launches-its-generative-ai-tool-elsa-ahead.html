They highlight Elsa's potential to dramatically reduce the time required for tasks that previously took days, thereby freeing up valuable time for scientists and reviewers to focus on more critical analysis and evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity and data privacy were key considerations in Elsa's development.
