Announced to take effect on August 1st, this move is reportedly contingent on Canada agreeing to build or manufacture the affected products within the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis threat represents a dramatic increase from previous top tariff rates, which were around 25% and first imposed in March. It is framed as part of the administration's broader strategy to renegotiate trade deals and encourage domestic production. The on-again, off-again trade disputes between the U.S. and Canada have seen various points of friction, and this latest declaration adds a new layer of complexity to the relationship between two of the world's most important trading partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitial reactions on social media to the potential tariff increase appear to be mostly positive among some segments, though the issue is also sparking debate. The implications of such a substantial tariff on Canadian industries and American consumers remain a key point of discussion as the August 1st deadline approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Trump Escalates Trade Tensions: Threatens 35% Tariff on Canadian Goods","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-11T08:24:19Z","summary":"President Trump has announced a potential 35% tariff on Canadian imports, effective August 1st, tied to a condition for Canada to build or manufacture products in the U.S. This move marks a significant escalation in trade relations.","tags":["Trade","Tariffs","Canada","United States","Donald Trump","Economy","Politics"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-threatens-35-tariff-on-some-canadian-goods/ar-AA1InsDH","title":"Trump Threatens 35% Tariff on Some Canadian Goods"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/trump-drops-new-tariff-threats-to-canada-in-deranged-letter/ar-AA1Io71I","title":"Trump Drops New Tariff Threats to Canada in Deranged Letter"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/trump-threatens-a-35-tariff-on-canadian-goods-and-he-may-double-what-most-other-nations-are-charged/ar-AA1IniF4","title":"Trump threatens a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, and he may double what most other nations are charged"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/trump-threatening-35-tariffs-on-canadian-goods-across-the-board/ar-AA1InbQj","title":"Trump threatening 35% tariffs on Canadian goods across the board"},{"url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/07/10/business/trump-canada-tariffs/","title":"Trump plans to hike tariffs on Canadian goods to 35 percent"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"trump-escalates-trade-tensions-threatens-35-tariff"},"buildId":"03BrIpIVasHgDSv9KISus","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
