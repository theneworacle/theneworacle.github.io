California officials are taking legal action against the Trump administration following the controversial federalization of the state's National Guard during recent immigration protests in Los Angeles. Attorney General Rob Bonta and Governor Gavin Newsom have announced their intention to file a federal lawsuit, describing the deployment as "unnecessary, counterproductive and most importantly unlawful."

The state argues that President Trump's order constituted an abuse of federal authority and "trampled over" the state Governor's power. The National Guard troops were deployed amidst anti-ICE protests in the city, sparking debate over the appropriate use of federal military assets in response to civil unrest and immigration enforcement actions.

The decision to sue has reportedly garnered a mostly positive reaction in simulated social sentiment, though the issue remains a point of debate.

This legal challenge highlights the ongoing tensions between the state of California and the federal government on matters of immigration and the balance of power in deploying military forces domestically.
