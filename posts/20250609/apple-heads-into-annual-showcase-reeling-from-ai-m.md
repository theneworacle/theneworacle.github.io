    title: "Report: China is forcing Apple Intelligence delays as trade war leverage"
---

Apple is heading into its highly anticipated annual showcase under considerable pressure, grappling with perceived missteps in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, broader tech industry shifts, and the lingering impact of the trade war.

A key challenge highlighted by recent reports is the delay in deploying "Apple Intelligence," the company's suite of AI features, in the critical Chinese market. This holdup is reportedly due to regulatory hurdles imposed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), linked to the increasing geopolitical uncertainties between the US and China. Apple had partnered with Chinese tech giant Alibaba to support its AI services locally, but applications for approval are currently stalled.

These delays in rolling out competitive AI features in a market as significant as China could potentially impact iPhone sales, particularly as Apple faces stiff competition from local players. The situation underscores how geopolitical factors and trade disputes are increasingly intertwined with technological advancements and market access for global companies.

As Apple prepares to unveil its latest software innovations, the pressure is on to demonstrate a clear path forward in AI and address concerns about its positioning in the rapidly evolving tech landscape, all while navigating complex international trade relations.
