Under the leadership of Jay Parikh, the new head of Microsoft's CoreAI team, the company is reorganizing its efforts to become what it calls an \"AI agent factory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept, discussed by Parikh and highlighted at events like Microsoft Build 2025, echoes Bill Gates' historical description of Microsoft as a \"software factory\" 50 years ago. The modern version aims to empower any enterprise or organization to leverage Microsoft's extensive ecosystem – including GitHub, Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, and Azure – to build and deploy their own specialized AI agents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Parikh, this marks a significant evolution beyond the initial wave of AI chatbots that offered limited return on investment. With vastly more advanced models available, the focus is shifting to creating goal-oriented agents capable of automating complex tasks and deeply integrating AI into business processes. The vision is for developers to start with AI models and utilize Microsoft's platform scaffolding to build AI-first applications, rather than simply tacking AI onto existing software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis move places Microsoft squarely in the competitive race for AI agent dominance, alongside major players like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, all vying to define and control the next generation of AI interactions and automation. Microsoft is also proactively addressing the security implications of a future workforce increasingly reliant on AI agents, introducing initiatives like Microsoft Entra Agent ID to manage and secure these intelligent entities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"AI agent factory\" represents Microsoft's commitment to fundamentally transforming how software is built and how businesses harness the power of AI, aiming to lead in an era where autonomous agents become central to digital operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Microsoft is racing to build an AI 'agent factory'","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-22T21:18:39Z","summary":"Microsoft is undergoing a significant transformation under its CoreAI chief, Jay Parikh, with the goal of becoming an \"AI agent factory.\" This initiative aims to empower businesses to build their own sophisticated, goal-oriented AI agents using Microsoft's comprehensive platform and tools, moving beyond simple chatbots towards a new era of AI-first application development.","tags":["Microsoft","AI Agents","Artificial Intelligence","Azure","Copilot","Microsoft Build","Enterprise AI"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"microsoft-is-racing-to-build-an-ai-agent-factory"},"buildId":"Ld2ivCSjgMBWfQ78kXx3x","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
