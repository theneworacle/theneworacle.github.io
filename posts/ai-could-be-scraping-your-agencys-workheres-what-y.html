This practice, often done without explicit permission or compensation, is raising alarms across the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as humans learn from existing information, large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems are trained on vast datasets pulled from the internet. This can include everything from blog posts, strategy briefs, and web copy to visual branding assets and case studies showcasing campaign strategies and unique problem-solving approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concern isn't merely about the content itself, but the underlying strategic thinking and competitive edge embedded within it. Agencies invest significant time and resources into developing unique methodologies and creative voices. When AI models ingest this material, they're not just copying words or images; they're learning to mimic the agency's distinct approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some in the industry are leveraging AI as a powerful tool for enhancing creativity and winning new business, the unauthorized scraping of proprietary work presents a clear challenge. It raises critical questions about copyright infringement, the ethical use of creative labor, and the potential for AI tools, trained on agency work, to become direct competitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisibility remains crucial for agencies seeking growth and new clients, making it impossible to simply remove all work from the web.
