The idea had long been sidelined due to the perceived technical hurdles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspired by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy's concept, Chen embraced \"vibe coding\" – using prompts fed to AI tools like Replit, ChatGPT, Cursor, and particularly Anthropic's Claude, to generate code. She describes the process of copying AI-generated code into Xcode, even without fully understanding its mechanics, as \"like magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding Dog-e-dex wasn't without its challenges. Chen navigated issues with integrating image recognition and even had to learn about the concept of a backend mid-development. She credits her engineering friends for some help but highlights Claude's significant role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen's standout advice for fellow aspiring \"vibe coders\"? Treat prompting AI like \"gentle parenting.\" This means being highly intentional and specific with instructions. She found that even a single word change, like asking for a \"custom\" navigation bar instead of just a standard one, could dramatically alter the result. Crucially, she learned that sometimes, AI needs to be \"babied,\" requiring instructions to be broken down step-by-step when it gets stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile AI proved powerful for coding, Chen noted that design was \"really hard to prompt.\" This observation strengthened her confidence in the safety of creative design jobs from AI disruption. She feels that the creativity required to troubleshoot and solve problems with AI is \"uniquely human,\" and that humans are still essential for big-picture thinking and conceptualizing novel ideas like a dog app, things AI doesn't yet do randomly or humorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, Chen believes the barrier to building with AI is no longer technical skill, but rather our own imagination, curiosity, and agency. Her advice: \"Just try things. Don't worry about if you'll fail or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDog-e-dex is still early days, with a modest number of downloads, but Chen finds joy in seeing users engage with the app and how it adds a positive element to their lives, including one touching instance where a user collected their late dog's photo as a memorial. The story resonates with the broader sentiment around AI app development, which, according to social sentiment analysis, is largely positive, mixed with some ongoing debate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen's experience provides a compelling case study in leveraging AI as a creative partner, demonstrating that with the right approach – perhaps a little \"gentle parenting\" – technical barriers are falling, opening up the world of creation to a wider audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"From Vibe Coding to App Store: How AI Helped Build a Dog ID App (and Why It Needs 'Parenting')","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-27T01:42:39Z","summary":"A product designer with no formal engineering background used AI to build a dog identification app, coining the term 'vibe coding' and sharing surprising insights into prompting AI.","tags":["AI","App Development","Vibe Coding","Prompting","No-code","Low-code","Creativity","Design","Claude","ChatGPT"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"from-vibe-coding-to-app-store-how-ai-helped-build-"},"buildId":"Ld2ivCSjgMBWfQ78kXx3x","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
