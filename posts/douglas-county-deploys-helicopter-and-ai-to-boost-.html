Secured through a $1.5 million contract, this aircraft can drop up to 300 gallons of water at a time. According to a county news release, Douglas County is now the only county in Colorado to have its own dedicated firefighting helicopter and crew available year-round, ensuring a swift aerial response whenever needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplementing the aerial support are Pano AI-backed cameras. These cameras utilize artificial intelligence to scan the landscape and detect potential fire starts early. The technology has already demonstrated its effectiveness, having been credited with the timely discovery and containment of a wildfire in the Bennett Mountain area last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not waiting for disaster to strike before we act,” said Douglas County Sheriff Darren Weekly in a release. “We’re building a wildfire response system that uses every tool available to protect lives, property and our natural resources.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe investment underscores a commitment to leveraging technology and dedicated resources to mitigate the increasing risk of wildfires, providing residents with a heightened sense of security as fire seasons potentially become more challenging.
