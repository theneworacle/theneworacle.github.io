The move comes weeks after the administration froze $584 million in federal research grants to the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAllegations of Civil Rights Violations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe White House and the Department of Justice have accused UCLA of civil rights violations, specifically citing \"deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.\" Reports also link the administration's actions to pro-Palestinian protests that occurred on the university's campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes UCLA the first public university to have its federal funding targeted by the administration over these specific allegations.
