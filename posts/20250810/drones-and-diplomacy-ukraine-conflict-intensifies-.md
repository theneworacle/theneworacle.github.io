### A Tale of Two Fronts: Combat and Conversation

In a stark illustration of the complexities of modern conflict, Russia and Ukraine exchanged large salvos of attack drones this weekend, even as diplomatic maneuvers for a high-stakes peace summit accelerate. The continued aerial assaults underscore a grim reality: the path to peace is being paved while the war rages on.

The backdrop for this continued violence is a planned meeting in Alaska between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, aimed at brokering an end to the nearly three-and-a-half-year-old war. But as the leaders prepare to talk, the drones continue to fly, signaling that diplomacy has not paused the violence on the ground.

### The Unseated Guest: Ukraine's Contentious Exclusion

The planned summit faces intense international criticism over a crucial omission: Ukraine. European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have issued strong warnings, insisting that no legitimate peace deal can be brokered without Kyiv's direct involvement. President Zelensky has been adamant that peace talks held "without Ukraine will not achieve anything."

In response to the growing outcry, President Trump has mentioned that he is "open to" inviting Zelensky, but no firm commitment has been made, leaving the nation at the heart of the conflict on the diplomatic sidelines.

### Skepticism from the Trenches

This high-level political chess match feels distant and abstract to those on the front lines. The sentiment was captured perfectly by one soldier's remark to The New York Times: "Here on the ground, we don't feel any real changes from all these high-level meetings and statements." This perspective highlights a deep-seated skepticism that talks held thousands of miles away can halt the daily violence and bring meaningful change.

The world now watches a precarious situation unfold. While social media reflects a cautious, if debated, optimism for a diplomatic solution, the ongoing drone attacks and the controversy surrounding Ukraine's exclusion cast a long shadow over the upcoming summit. The fundamental question remains: can genuine peace be negotiated while the fighting continues and the primary nation under attack is left waiting for an invitation?
