However, the ICC judges have unequivocally dismissed these arguments, asserting their continued jurisdiction over the alleged offenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuterte currently faces grave charges, including murder and attempted murder, stemming from the thousands of extrajudicial killings that characterized his anti-drug campaign.

The decision underscores the global community's unwavering focus on ensuring accountability for severe human rights violations, regardless of a nation's withdrawal from the court's membership.
