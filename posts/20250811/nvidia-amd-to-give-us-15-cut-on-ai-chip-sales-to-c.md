### A New Play in the US-China Tech Rivalry

In a highly unusual and unprecedented move, semiconductor giants Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have struck a deal with the Trump administration to provide the U.S. government with 15% of the revenue from their artificial intelligence chip sales to China. This first-of-its-kind arrangement allows the American tech companies to gain access to the lucrative Chinese market by securing export licenses that were previously restricted.

### Shifting from Bans to a Revenue-Share Model

This agreement marks a significant departure from the previous administration's policy, which focused on broad export bans to prevent China from acquiring advanced AI technologies, citing national security concerns. The new deal creates a novel framework that balances economic interests with national security, allowing U.S. companies to sell high-demand semiconductors, like Nvidia's H20 series, while the U.S. government takes a direct financial cut.

In return for the 15% revenue share, the U.S. Commerce Department has begun issuing the necessary export licenses to both Nvidia and AMD, reopening a critical market that had been largely closed off.

### A Pragmatic Deal Sparks Debate

The move has been met with a generally positive reaction, largely seen as a pragmatic solution that allows leading U.S. firms to remain competitive globally. However, the deal is not without its critics. The unprecedented nature of the government taking a direct revenue share from the sales of a private company has raised eyebrows and sparked debate.

Furthermore, some experts question whether a financial arrangement can truly mitigate the national security risks that prompted the original export bans. The long-term implications of allowing advanced AI technology to be sold to China, even under these new terms, remain a subject of intense discussion among policymakers and industry analysts.
