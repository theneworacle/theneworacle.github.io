Generative artificial intelligence continues its march into the federal government, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marking a significant milestone this week.

The agency officially launched its first generative AI tool, nicknamed **Elsa**, surprising many by deploying it ahead of its anticipated late June schedule and notably, under budget. This move signals a new era for the FDA, aiming to leverage AI to streamline operations and improve efficiency across the board.

Elsa is designed to be a powerful assistant for FDA staff, tackling a variety of tasks that are often time-consuming. Its capabilities include assisting with scientific reviews, reading and summarizing complex documents, generating code for nonclinical applications, and helping identify high-priority inspection targets.

FDA officials have voiced strong support and enthusiasm for the tool. They highlight Elsa's potential to dramatically reduce the time required for tasks that previously took days, thereby freeing up valuable time for scientists and reviewers to focus on more critical analysis and evaluation.

Security and data privacy were key considerations in Elsa's development. The FDA states the tool was trained *without* utilizing data submitted by regulated industries, ensuring sensitive research and information remain protected. Elsa's infrastructure is housed within GovCloud, Amazon Web Services' product designed for classified information.

While the launch has been met with mostly positive sentiment, there is some debate, particularly in the context of the agency potentially facing budget cuts and having recently undergone layoffs. Concerns about the need for continued human oversight and the risks associated with AI hallucinations – instances where the AI generates false or misleading information – have also been acknowledged.

Despite these challenges, the FDA views Elsa as a foundational step. The agency plans to expand the tool's use and integrate more data processing and generative AI functions throughout its centers as Elsa matures, further supporting its mission to protect public health.
