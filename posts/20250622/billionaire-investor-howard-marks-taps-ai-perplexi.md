In a move that signals the growing integration of artificial intelligence into even the most traditional fields, billionaire investor Howard Marks has revealed he used an AI tool, Perplexity, to help write his latest memo.

Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management and author of influential memos on value investing, disclosed the AI assistance in his recent memo titled "More On Repealing The Laws Of Economics." This admission from a figure as respected and prominent as Marks underscores the expanding adoption of AI tools across various professional domains.

The use of AI by a seasoned investor like Marks has garnered mostly positive sentiment on social media, with many viewing it as an embrace of modern technology. However, there is also some debate surrounding the implications of using AI for such impactful work and the nature of AI-generated content.

The news also comes as Perplexity itself faces scrutiny, including a "cease and desist" notice from The New York Times regarding its use of content from publishers. This broader context highlights the ongoing challenges and ethical considerations surrounding the data sources and practices of AI tools like Perplexity.

Marks's willingness to publicly acknowledge using AI for his writing is a notable moment, demonstrating how rapidly these technologies are moving from niche applications to becoming assistants for even the most established voices.
