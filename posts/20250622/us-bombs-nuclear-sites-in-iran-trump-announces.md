In a major development announced by President Donald Trump, the United States has reportedly bombed three nuclear sites in Iran: Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. This action represents the first direct military strike by the U.S. against Iran and a substantial escalation in the existing tensions between Israel and Iran.

According to reports, President Trump revealed the strikes via Truth Social. The decision for U.S. involvement reportedly followed a week of consideration by the President and has led to division among Republicans, including some of his key allies.

The U.S. government's stated objective in targeting these sites is to hinder Tehran's potential to acquire nuclear weapons. This move adds a new, volatile dimension to the already complex security landscape in the Middle East.
