A shooting incident at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, on Sunday, June 22, 2025, was quickly brought to an end by the swift actions of a church security guard. Authorities confirmed that the security guard shot and killed the suspected active shooter.

The incident occurred during a Bible school service, with approximately 150 people in attendance, including many children. A livestream of the service, captured by news outlets, showed the moment the shooting began, with shouting and attendees ducking for cover. Reports indicate that the 31-year-old male suspect fired shots into the church from outside the building. In addition to the security guard's response, a deacon reportedly ran the shooter over with a vehicle, which may have facilitated the security guard's ability to neutralize the threat.

At least one person inside the church was injured, suffering a gunshot wound to the leg. The Wayne Police Department is currently investigating the incident with the assistance of multiple agencies. Authorities have asked the public to avoid the area as the investigation continues.

Social media reaction to the event has been largely positive, highlighting the heroic actions of the security guard, though some debate surrounding the incident is also present online.
