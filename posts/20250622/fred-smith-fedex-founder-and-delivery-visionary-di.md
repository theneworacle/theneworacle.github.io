The business world is mourning the loss of a true innovator. Fred Smith, the visionary founder of FedEx, has died at 80. A Marine Corps veteran, Smith revolutionized the logistics and transportation industry by introducing the concept of absolutely, positively overnight package delivery, a service that was initially sketched out in a college paper and widely doubted before becoming a global standard.

Smith's bold idea faced skepticism, but his determination built FedEx into a multinational corporation that fundamentally changed how businesses and individuals send and receive goods. His legacy extends beyond delivery; he also had a notable impact on the sports world as a former minority owner of the NFL's Washington Commanders, with FedEx also holding the naming rights to the team's stadium for many years.

His influence on American business and global commerce is undeniable. As news of his passing spreads, social media sentiment reflects widespread recognition of his achievements, acknowledging the profound impact FedEx has had on modern life, and highlighting deep respect for his entrepreneurial spirit and lasting contributions.
