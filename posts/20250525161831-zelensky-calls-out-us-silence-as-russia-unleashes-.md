# Zelensky Calls Out US 'Silence' as Russia Unleashes Record Air Assault

The conflict in Ukraine escalated dramatically overnight as Russia launched its most massive aerial bombardment of the war, targeting cities and regions across the country with hundreds of drones and missiles. The brutal assault resulted in widespread destruction, the deaths of at least 12 people – including three children – and left dozens more injured.

In the wake of this record attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a pointed rebuke to international partners, specifically calling out the United States for its "silence."

"America’s silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin," Zelensky stated in a Telegram post. He argued that each such terrorist attack by Russia is sufficient reason for new sanctions and that the war continues relentlessly, regardless of weekends or holidays, and cannot be ignored.

Ukraine's Air Force reported that Russia launched 367 aerial attack weapons, comprising 69 missiles and 298 drones, targeting 22 locations. Ukrainian defenses managed to intercept 47 of the missiles and 266 of the drones.

Tragically, the human cost is immense. The deaths include a family of three children in the Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, whose parents were also hospitalized. Civilian buildings in Kyiv and other areas sustained significant damage.

The timing of the assault is also notable, occurring despite the completion of the largest prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine since the war began – a rare moment of cooperation overshadowed by the renewed violence.

Zelensky is now renewing calls for strong international pressure and fresh sanctions against Russia, emphasizing that without such measures, the brutality will continue. While the focus remains on the Russian offensive, reports also emerged of Ukraine launching drone attacks on Russian territory during the same period.

Zelensky's direct criticism highlights the urgency felt in Kyiv for continued and vocal international support and action in the face of relentless Russian aggression.
