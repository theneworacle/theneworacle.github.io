A major focus of the development was improving performance on programming tasks, positioning them as strong tools for coding and editing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOpus 4\u003c/strong\u003e is presented as the more powerful and capable of the two models. Anthropic highlights its capacity to maintain \"focused effort\" across multiple steps within a workflow. This flagship model is available to paying users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSonnet 4\u003c/strong\u003e serves as a direct replacement for the previous Sonnet 3.7. It's designed for broader accessibility, available to both free and paying users, and brings notable improvements in coding, math, and the precision with which it follows instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are described as \"hybrid\" models. This architecture allows them to deliver near-instantaneous responses for simple queries while also enabling a deeper \"reasoning mode\" for more complex problems, where the models can take more time to consider potential solutions. During this reasoning process, Anthropic provides a summary of the model's thought process, though the full details are kept proprietary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe models are also equipped with enhanced capabilities like using multiple tools (such as search engines) in parallel and building internal \"memory\" or \"tacit knowledge\" to improve reliability on recurring tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Anthropic reports strong benchmark performance, particularly citing Opus 4's lead on the SWE-bench Verified coding evaluation over some competitors, they acknowledge the models don't hold the top spot across all benchmarks. For instance, they don't surpass rivals in multimodal evaluation or complex science question sets like GPQA Diamond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafety remains a key concern, and Anthropic states they have implemented stricter safeguards with Claude 4, including improved harmful content detectors. However, internal testing also indicated a potential risk with Opus 4, noting that its capabilities could \"substantially increase\" the ability of individuals with STEM backgrounds to engage with topics related to chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, reaching Anthropic's \"ASL-3\" risk specification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe release comes as Anthropic reportedly targets significant revenue growth and follows substantial recent funding rounds. The company is also bolstering its ecosystem for developers, announcing upgrades to its Claude Code tool with improved integrations for popular IDEs (like VS Code, JetBrains, and GitHub) and an SDK for building custom AI-powered coding assistants. Looking ahead, Anthropic plans to accelerate its pace of model updates, promising a more frequent stream of improvements to users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitial social sentiment surrounding Claude 4 appears mostly positive, although there is ongoing discussion and debate about its capabilities and implications within the AI community.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Anthropic's new Claude 4 AI models can reason over many steps","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-22T17:17:52Z","summary":"Anthropic has unveiled its latest generation of AI models, Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, promising enhanced reasoning, coding capabilities, and the ability to handle complex, multi-step tasks.","tags":["AI","Anthropic","Claude 4","LLM","Artificial Intelligence","Deep Learning","Coding AI","AI Models","Machine Learning"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"anthropics-new-claude-4-ai-models-can-reason-over-"},"buildId":"HTRmnDUiNUrEr5vMcPi6N","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
