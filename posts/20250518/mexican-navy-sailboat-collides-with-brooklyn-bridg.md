A dramatic and unexpected incident unfolded in New York City this past Saturday evening when a Mexican Navy tall ship, reportedly on a training cruise, collided with the underside of the iconic Brooklyn Bridge.

The vessel, identified in some reports as the Cuauhtemoc, was sailing through the East River when its mast brushed against the span of the bridge. The collision occurred just before 8:30 p.m.

The impact was significant enough to cause damage to the ship, with reports indicating snapped masts. More importantly, it resulted in injuries to those on board. Officials confirmed that at least 19 individuals were injured, with four sustaining serious injuries. Emergency services responded to the scene, and rescue efforts were undertaken to assist those affected.

Fortunately, despite the striking nature of the collision, officials stated that the Brooklyn Bridge itself did not sustain any structural damage from the incident.

The sight of the damaged tall ship drifting near the shore drew attention from onlookers. The event, involving a foreign naval vessel and a famous landmark, quickly became a topic of discussion.

Initial social media sentiment surrounding the incident appears to be mostly positive, perhaps focused on the unusual nature of the event and the relief that bridge damage was avoided, though some debate on the circumstances is also present.

The incident serves as a reminder of the challenges and potential hazards involved in navigating complex waterways, even for experienced crews on training voyages.
