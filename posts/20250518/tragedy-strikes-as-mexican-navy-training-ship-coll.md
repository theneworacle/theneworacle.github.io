A dramatic and tragic incident unfolded on a recent Saturday evening in New York City when the Mexican Navy training ship *Cuauhtémoc* collided with the underside of the iconic Brooklyn Bridge.

The vessel, known as the "Ambassador and Knight of the Seas," was carrying 277 passengers and crew on a global goodwill tour, departing from Pier 17 en route to Iceland. However, as it passed beneath the historic bridge, disaster struck.

According to preliminary reports from officials, the ship experienced a "mechanical issue" or "lost power," causing it to veer off course and impact the bridge structure. Eyewitnesses on the Brooklyn promenade described the scene as "surreal" as the tall ship unexpectedly drew too close to the bridge.

The ship's towering masts struck the underside of the bridge with force, snapping and sending debris tumbling onto the deck below. This collision had devastating consequences.

Tragically, two individuals were killed in the incident after falling from one of the masts. It's worth noting that it is a ceremonial tradition for sailors on vessels like the *Cuauhtémoc* to climb the masts upon arriving or departing a harbor. Around 20 other people were injured, with two sustaining serious injuries.

Emergency services, including over 100 fire and EMS personnel, swiftly responded to the scene, setting up command posts on both the Brooklyn and Manhattan sides of the river. Marine units assisted in the response, helping to ensure the safety of those on board.

The Brooklyn Bridge was temporarily closed for inspection but was found to have sustained no visible structural damage and was later reopened to traffic.

The *Cuauhtémoc* has since been moved to Pier 36 to allow passengers to disembark and authorities to investigate.

The cause of the collision remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. As the investigation unfolds, the maritime community and observers reflect on this somber event that highlights the inherent risks, even during what should have been a ceremonial departure, and the tragic human cost involved.
