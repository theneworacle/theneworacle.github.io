A tragic incident unfolded Saturday night in New York Harbor when a Mexican Navy training vessel, the *Cuauhtémoc*, struck the underside of the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. The collision resulted in fatalities and multiple injuries among those aboard the ship.

The *Cuauhtémoc*, known as the "Ambassador and Knight of the Seas," is a training sailing ship on a global goodwill tour. Carrying 277 people, it was departing from Pier 17 in New York and heading towards Iceland when the incident occurred around 8:20 p.m. local time.

As the tall ship passed under the bridge, its masts struck the structure with force, snapping on impact and sending debris onto the deck. Tragically, two individuals were killed in the incident; officials reported they fell from one of the ship's masts. Additionally, between 19 and 22 people were injured, with some sustaining critical injuries.

The cause of the collision is currently under investigation. Initial reports suggest possible "mechanical issues" or the ship "losing power" may have contributed to the accident, but officials caution this information is preliminary. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is also conducting an investigation.

Witnesses on the shore reported seeing people on the ship's masts both before and during the collision. It's noted that climbing the masts and rigging is a ceremonial tradition for sailors on such vessels when arriving or departing a harbor.

Emergency services, including the FDNY, police, and EMS, responded rapidly to the scene. The Brooklyn Bridge was briefly closed for assessment but was found to have no structural damage and was reopened later. The *Cuauhtémoc* was subsequently moved to New York's Pier 36 to allow passengers to disembark.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed deep sadness over the loss of life and sent condolences to the families of the two crew members who died.

As investigations continue, the maritime community and onlookers await further details on what led to this unfortunate event.
