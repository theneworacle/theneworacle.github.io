In a significant health update, former U.S. President Joe Biden's office announced Sunday that he has been diagnosed with an "aggressive form" of prostate cancer.

According to statements released by his office and corroborated by multiple news outlets, the cancer has reportedly metastasized to the bone. This indicates a more advanced stage of the disease.

The announcement comes after Biden was seen by doctors last week following the discovery of urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule.

His office stated that the former president and his family are currently reviewing treatment options with his medical team. While the diagnosis is described as aggressive, reports suggest the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which can be a factor in effective management.

The news has drawn attention to prostate cancer, a common cancer among men, particularly as they age. While the specifics of President Biden's case are private, the diagnosis highlights the importance of regular health check-ups and screenings.

Simulated social media sentiment regarding the news has been largely positive, with expressions of support and well wishes for the former president and his family, alongside some related discussions.

Further updates on his treatment plan and condition are expected to be provided as they become available.
