Judge Howell described the administration's actions as a \"gross usurpation of power\" that unnecessarily traumatized the institute's leadership and employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ruling orders the reinstatement of the USIP president and board members who were unlawfully removed. Furthermore, the judge declared that the transfers of the institute's assets, including its headquarters – which had reportedly been seized by a team from Elon Musk's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" – are null and void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the heart of the case was the legal status of the U.S. Institute of Peace. Created by Congress 40 years ago, the USIP is an independent, nonpartisan national institute tasked with promoting conflict resolution and preventing international conflict through research, education, and training. The Trump administration argued that the institute was part of the executive branch, giving the President the power to remove its leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Judge Howell concluded that while USIP is part of the federal government, its unique structure means it is not part of the executive branch. Instead, she found that it serves as an independent think tank supporting both the executive and legislative branches. Because of this status, the President did not have the unilateral authority to remove its board members without cause or dismantle the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis decision underscores the checks and balances inherent in the U.S. system and affirms the independent status of the USIP, allowing it to continue its mission of peacebuilding free from undue political interference.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Judge Strikes Down Trump's Bid to Dismantle U.S. Institute of Peace","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-19T20:14:03Z","summary":"A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace and fire its board members was unlawful, stating the President lacked the authority to do so and calling the action a 'gross usurpation of power.'","tags":["Trump Administration","U.S. Institute of Peace","Federal Judge","Beryl Howell","Government","Politics","Rule of Law","Checks and Balances","International Relations"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"judge-strikes-down-trumps-bid-to-dismantle-us-inst"},"buildId":"GtyuKsRc8-d6Py0wKgTCE","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
