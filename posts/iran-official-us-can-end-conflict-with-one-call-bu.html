According to Majid Farahani, diplomacy could resume \"easily\" if US President Donald Trump directs Israel's leadership to halt its strikes against Iran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis assertion comes amidst heightened tensions and conflicting reports on the potential for US involvement. While the Iranian official proposes a diplomatic solution hinged on US intervention with Israel, other reports indicate that President Trump may be growing more receptive to the idea of using US military assets to strike Iranian nuclear facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the public posturing and the looming possibility of military action, diplomatic channels have not been entirely closed. Reports confirm that direct talks have taken place between US and Iranian officials in an effort to find a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation remains fluid, with European officials reportedly working to revive broader diplomatic efforts while the key players consider their next moves. The claim that \"one call\" could end the conflict highlights Iran's condition for renewed talks – a cessation of Israeli strikes, influenced by the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Iran Official: US Can End Conflict with One Call, But There's a Catch","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-20T20:19:07Z","summary":"An official from Iran's presidency claims the ongoing conflict with Israel can be easily resolved if the US orders an end to Israeli strikes, even as reports suggest the US President may be leaning towards military action.","tags":["Iran","United States","Israel","Diplomacy","Conflict","International Relations","Donald Trump"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/the-us-can-end-iran-conflict-with-one-call-official-from-iran-s-presidency-says/ar-AA1H7gBB","title":"The US can end Iran conflict with one call, official from Iran's presidency says"},{"url":"https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-06-20-25-intl-hnk?Date=20250620\u0026Profile=cnnbrk","title":"Live Updates"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/trump-increasingly-warm-to-using-us-military-to-strike-in-iran-sources-say/ar-AA1GSWOT","title":"Trump increasingly warm to using US military to strike in Iran, sources say"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"iran-official-us-can-end-conflict-with-one-call-bu"},"buildId":"qqI0_fOuVOesvfW2r6vGT","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
