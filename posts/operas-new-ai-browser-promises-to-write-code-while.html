Instead of just fetching information, its AI agents are designed to understand context and execute specific jobs across the internet. The capabilities highlighted are particularly ambitious, including the ability to \u003cstrong\u003ewrite code for websites and even games\u003c/strong\u003e, automate online shopping processes, and generate detailed reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most intriguing claims is that these agents can perform tasks while the user is seemingly inactive or even \"while you are asleep.\" This suggests a level of autonomy and background processing aimed at maximizing efficiency and leveraging downtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this advanced functionality comes with a price.

Yet, there's also \u003cstrong\u003esome debate\u003c/strong\u003e, likely centering on the subscription model, the reliability and control over autonomous agents, and the implications of a browser that actively works in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpera Neon represents a notable step in the evolution of web browsers, shifting the paradigm from a simple interface for accessing information to a proactive, intelligent assistant integrated directly into the browsing experience.
