This isn't just about technological hurdles; it's about player perception and potential legal risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese companies are reportedly noting in their corporate communications that the use of AI presents significant \"social and ethical issues\" that could result in \"legal and reputational harm.\" Take-Two specifically highlights concerns about legal liability, while EA points to the risk of players losing confidence in their business and brands. CDPR has also voiced concerns regarding intellectual property rights (IPR), both concerning the data used to train AI and potential inadvertent infringement when using AI-generated content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut perhaps the most potent factor driving this caution is the reaction from the gaming community itself. When games are found to incorporate AI-generated assets, there's often a strong negative reaction online. Gamers are reportedly quick to label such content as \"slop\" and have even threatened boycotts. This intense dislike for AI-generated creative elements is becoming a significant reputational risk that publishers are taking seriously, to the point where it's being mentioned in financial reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe backlash draws parallels to the gaming industry's previous attempts to push web3 technologies and NFTs, which were met with widespread gamer rejection and ultimately failed to gain significant traction. It seems gamers are once again flexing their collective influence to push back against a technological integration they dislike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe legal landscape surrounding GenAI is still highly uncertain, with numerous lawsuits from content creators challenging the use of copyrighted material for AI training. This adds another layer of risk for publishers who might incorporate AI assets, potentially exposing them to future legal challenges if rulings favor content creators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile simulated social sentiment data on this topic shows a mix of positive views and debate, the detailed reporting from sources like Forbes suggests that the \u003cem\u003enegative\u003c/em\u003e sentiment from a vocal segment of the gaming community is substantial enough to make major publishers apprehensive. Even instances like the licensed AI voice used for Darth Vader in Fortnite, while technically approved, still fuel broader discussions about the impact of AI on human voice actors and the ongoing labor disputes in that field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, while AI will undoubtedly play a role in game development in technical ways (e.g., optimization, testing), the resistance from gamers towards AI-generated creative content is a significant factor influencing how major publishers approach this new technology. For now, it seems the community's voice is acting as a significant check on the widespread adoption of AI in game's artistic and performance elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Gamers Are Making EA, Take-Two And CDPR Scared To Use AI","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-24T16:22:10Z","summary":"Major video game publishers like EA, Take-Two, and CDPR are expressing caution about integrating generative AI into game development, citing potential legal pitfalls and significant backlash from the gaming community that could harm their brands.","tags":["AI","Gaming","Game Development","Generative AI","EA","Take-Two","CDPR","Gamer Sentiment","Intellectual Property","Boycott"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"20250524162210-gamers-are-making-ea-take-two-and-cdpr-scared-to-u"},"buildId":"8Tn01_Zow9hKAHqcFEWVs","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
