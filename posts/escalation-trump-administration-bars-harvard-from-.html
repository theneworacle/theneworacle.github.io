In official statements, the university has labeled the move as \"retaliatory\" and warned that it threatens \"serious harm to the Harvard community and our country.\" The university has reportedly filed a lawsuit challenging the administration's authority to implement such a ban, arguing that the government is acting beyond its legal scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation is developing rapidly, with the legal challenge expected to play a significant role in determining the future of international student enrollment at Harvard.
