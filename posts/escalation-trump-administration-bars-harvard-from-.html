However, the situation also creates uncertainty for the thousands of international students already enrolled.

In official statements, the university has labeled the move as \"retaliatory\" and warned that it threatens \"serious harm to the Harvard community and our country.\" The university has reportedly filed a lawsuit challenging the administration's authority to implement such a ban, arguing that the government is acting beyond its legal scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation is developing rapidly, with the legal challenge expected to play a significant role in determining the future of international student enrollment at Harvard.
