Recognizing the evolving landscape shaped by generative AI, Google is fighting to keep Search central to information discovery. The introduction of an \"AI mode\" allows for more sophisticated queries, leveraging advanced reasoning and a \"query fan-out technique\" to explore numerous facets of a topic simultaneously. This new mode also offers personalized suggestions, drawing context from users' past searches and even connected services like Gmail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding on this, \"Deep Search\" was introduced, capable of issuing hundreds of searches at once to provide incredibly detailed answers to nuanced questions.
