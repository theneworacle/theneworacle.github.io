Recent developments suggest a potential shift in power dynamics that could see the elite force tightening its grip on both state affairs and the national economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne contributing factor to this potential power concentration is the impact of targeted Israeli strikes. While aimed at key figures within Iran's military and intelligence apparatus, these strikes have reportedly eliminated top aides close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This loss of seasoned advisors could inadvertently create a vacuum, leading to more power being concentrated within the core IRGC leadership or potentially accelerating the rise of Khamenei's son, Mojtaba.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, reports indicate deliberate plans by the Iranian regime to grant the IRGC sweeping control over vital sectors of the economy, including oil, petrochemicals, steel, and mining. Sources suggest this move is intended not only to help the IRGC circumvent international sanctions but also to provide significant financial resources for its activities, including domestic oppression and support for regional proxies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe IRGC is already designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, known for its role in training, funding, and equipping militant groups across the Middle East and beyond. As the IRGC gains greater economic control and potentially consolidates political power, concerns are heightened regarding its capacity to further destabilize the region and intensify its support for terrorism-linked activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis potential consolidation of power by the IRGC represents a significant development with implications for Iran's internal politics, its economic future, and its interactions on the international stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Poised for More Power","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-20T04:25:28Z","summary":"Recent events, including targeted Israeli strikes and alleged plans to seize control of key economic sectors, suggest that Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is consolidating its influence, potentially leading to shifts in the country's power structure and raising concerns about regional stability.","tags":["Iran","IRGC","Middle East","Geopolitics","Israeli Strikes","Terrorism","Economy","Khamenei","Power"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/iran-s-islamic-revolutionary-guard-poised-for-more-power/ar-AA1H3MBC","title":"Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Poised for More Power"},{"url":"https://pragativadi.com/khamenei-isolated-as-top-aides-killed-in-Israeli-strikes-son-mojtaba-poised-to-rise/","title":"Khamenei Isolated as Top Aides Killed in Israeli Strikes; Son Mojtaba Poised to Rise"},{"url":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/irans-regime-plans-give-power-profits-terrorism-linked-group-documents-reveal","title":"Iran's regime plans to give power, profits to terrorism-linked group, documents reveal"},{"url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/10/27/what-does-irgc-stand-for/71339282007/","title":"What is Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and why did US launch strikes against it?"},{"url":"https://www.newsweek.com/call-irans-revolutionary-guards-what-they-are-terrorists-opinion-1765451","title":"Call Iran's Revolutionary Guards What They Are: Terrorists | Opinion"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"irans-islamic-revolutionary-guard-poised-for-more-"},"buildId":"8Tn01_Zow9hKAHqcFEWVs","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
