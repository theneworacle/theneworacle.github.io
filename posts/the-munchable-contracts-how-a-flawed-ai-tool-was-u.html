Its ambitious goal: to analyze and slash 50 percent of federal regulations, streamlining a bureaucracy often criticized as bloated and inefficient. On the surface, it's the kind of tech-forward initiative that garners positive headlines and resonates with a public eager to see government waste cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Troubling Reality Uncovered\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a deeper look by investigative outlets like ProPublica and Talking Points Memo paints a far more concerning picture. The AI tool, far from being a sophisticated arbiter of regulatory excess, was reportedly \"flawed\" and \"error-prone.\" Its initial target wasn't just any government department, but the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which relies on a vast network of contracts to provide care and services to former military members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI was tasked with identifying contracts that could be terminated, a process the developer bluntly labeled as finding which ones were \"MUNCHABLE.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe 10,000-Character Flaw\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core of the problem lies in the AI's shockingly superficial methodology. According to reports, the tool was programmed to make its complex judgments based on only the first 10,000 characters—roughly 2,500 words—of a contract. This meant that critical details buried deeper in lengthy legal documents were completely ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis simplistic approach led the AI to flag over 2,000 VA contracts for potential termination. The engineer who built the tool acknowledged the flaws, stating, \"I would never recommend someone run my code and do what it says. It’s like that ‘Office’ episode where Steve Carell drives into the lake because Google Maps says drive into the lake. Do not drive into the lake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eReal-World Consequences for Veterans\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn't a theoretical exercise. The flawed analysis had real-world consequences, jeopardizing services crucial for veteran care. Among the contracts canceled were agreements for maintaining a gene sequencing device used in cancer research and for providing tools to improve nursing care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile DOGE officials passed the AI's recommendations to VA employees for a final review, the process has been criticized for its lack of transparency. The incident serves as a stark cautionary tale about the rush to implement AI in critical government functions. The promise of efficiency can quickly be overshadowed by the peril of poor execution, especially when the well-being of the nation's veterans is on the line. The case of the \"munchable\" contracts highlights an urgent need for rigorous oversight, transparency, and a human-centered approach to a government AI strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"The 'Munchable' Contracts: How a Flawed AI Tool Was Used to Cut Veterans' Services","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-26T16:21:48Z","summary":"The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) deployed an AI tool to slash federal regulations, but investigative reports reveal the 'error-prone' system may have unjustly targeted essential services for veterans based on a superficial analysis of contracts.","tags":["AI","Government","DOGE","Veterans Affairs","Regulation","Tech Policy","AI Ethics"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/doge-builds-ai-tool-to-cut-50-percent-of-federal-regulations/ar-AA1JkYVU","title":"DOGE builds AI tool to cut 50 percent of federal regulations"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/doge-used-flawed-ai-tool-to-munch-veteran-affairs-contracts-report-claims/ar-AA1GeInQ","title":"DOGE used flawed AI tool to ‘munch’ Veteran Affairs contracts, report claims"},{"url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/doge-developed-error-prone-ai-tool-to-munch-veterans-affairs-contracts","title":"DOGE Developed Error-Prone AI Tool To ‘Munch’ Veterans Affairs Contracts"},{"url":"https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-ai-tool-doge-veterans-affairs-contracts-sahil-lavingia","title":"Inside the AI Tool Used by DOGE to Review Veterans Affairs Contracts"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"the-munchable-contracts-how-a-flawed-ai-tool-was-u"},"buildId":"VUXt6tov68FgUsvVZCgNZ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
