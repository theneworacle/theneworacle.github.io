Los Angeles authorities initiated mass arrests in the downtown area after a curfew, ordered by Mayor Karen Bass, took effect. The measure was put in place as a response to ongoing looting and vandalism that occurred amidst protests against recent federal immigration crackdowns under President Trump's administration.

Police were quick to enforce the curfew, making arrests shortly after the designated time and employing crowd control tactics against demonstrators who defied the order.

The situation drew commentary from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who reportedly described the federal government's handling of the anti-immigration raid protests as "purposefully inflammatory."

Initial social media reactions to the mass arrests and curfew appear to be largely positive, though some debate is also present.
