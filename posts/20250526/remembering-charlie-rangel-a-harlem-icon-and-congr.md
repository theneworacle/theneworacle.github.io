The nation is mourning the loss of Charles B. Rangel, the charismatic and influential former U.S. Representative who served the people of Harlem for an extraordinary 47 years. Rangel, a true fixture in New York and national politics, died on Monday at the age of 94.

A decorated veteran of the Korean War, where he earned a Purple Heart, Rangel's dedication to service extended far beyond the battlefield. He was a prominent civil rights activist, fighting for equality and justice throughout his career.

Entering Congress in 1971, Rangel quickly became a key voice for his constituents and a powerful force on Capitol Hill. He was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, an organization dedicated to advocating for the legislative priorities of Black Americans.

His influence grew significantly when he became the first African American to chair the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, overseeing critical legislation related to taxation, trade, and social security. In this role, he wielded considerable legislative power, advocating tirelessly for policies aimed at lifting up working families and underserved communities.

Rangel's gravelly voice and sharp wit were instantly recognizable, and his deep connection to Harlem was legendary. He was a mentor to many and a symbol of perseverance and political savvy.

Tributes have poured in from across the political spectrum, celebrating his long career, his dedication to public service, and his profound impact on shaping both policy and the political landscape for generations to come. His passing marks the end of an era in American politics, leaving behind a legacy defined by advocacy, leadership, and an unwavering commitment to his community.
