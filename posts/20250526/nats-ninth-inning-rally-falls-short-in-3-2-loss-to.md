Another close one slips away. The Washington Nationals fell to the San Francisco Giants on Sunday with a final score of 3-2, ceding the three-game series to their West Coast opponents.

The game remained tight throughout, ultimately coming down to the wire in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Nationals, known for their late-game resilience this season, managed to get the tying run to third base. However, a crucial potential tying double hooked just foul down the line, ending the rally and the game, leaving the runner stranded just 180 feet from home plate.

On the mound for the Giants, Robbie Ray continued his impressive form, moving to 7-0 on the season with six strong innings. Sam Huff provided a key offensive spark with a home run. The Giants' bullpen also proved effective in holding the Nationals' offense in check.

For the Nationals, Michael Soroka delivered a quality start, pitching six innings and allowing three runs on five hits and a walk, despite ultimately taking the loss, his first of the season. While the team fought hard, the loss reportedly highlighted the importance of a key offensive ranking for the Nationals moving forward.

Though the Nationals couldn't complete the comeback, the close nature of the contest reflects their competitive spirit. They will look to bounce back in their next series.
