However, a recent update to the Terms of Service for its Kobo Writing Life self-publishing platform is causing apprehension among some writers, potentially challenging that image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe updated terms, which took effect on June 28th, grant Kobo the right to use \"artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning algorithms or similar technologies\" to \"read, analyze, and process\" authors' uploaded works. Kobo explicitly states this processing is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e for the purpose of training generative AI models to create new content. Instead, the intended uses include enhancing discoverability through tagging and recommendations, evaluating works for the store, generating promotional materials like keywords and ad content, and providing reader assistance features like recaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite Kobo's assurance about not training generative AI, authors voiced surprise and concern. A significant point of contention is the lack of an opt-out mechanism; authors who are uncomfortable with any AI analysis of their work must apparently remove their content from the platform entirely. Authors also expressed general skepticism and dislike towards AI's increasing presence in publishing, mirroring broader industry debates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcerns extend to the practical application of these AI tools. Authors worry about potential inaccuracies in AI-generated tags or promotional content. The possibility of AI-powered recaps, similar to a feature Amazon implemented on Kindle, also raises red flags, particularly given instances of Amazon's AI providing incorrect summaries for some books. For self-published authors who rely on direct relationships with their readers, inaccurate AI features could damage that connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKobo's CEO, Michael Tamblyn, has publicly addressed the changes, explaining on social media that the goal is to use AI to improve the connection between readers and authors and to streamline platform operations. He reiterated Kobo's commitment to not using authors' books to create new content and to respecting copyright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis situation at Kobo is part of a larger industry-wide conversation about the role of AI, intellectual property rights, and the future of creative work. While Kobo's approach appears less aggressive than using content for generative training – a practice the Authors Guild actively opposes – the lack of author control and transparency around the specific AI technologies being used remains a point of friction. As AI integration continues across publishing platforms, the balance between technological advancement and author rights will remain a critical debate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"AI might undermine one of the better alternatives to the Kindle","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-28T12:41:22Z","summary":"Kobo, often seen as an author-friendly alternative to Amazon Kindle, has updated its terms of service to allow AI analysis of authors' work.
