A White House report intended to address declining life expectancy in the United States, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and titled "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA), is drawing significant criticism after independent analysis revealed substantial inaccuracies.

Experts examining the report have pointed to numerous errors, most notably the citation of studies that do not exist and the misrepresentation of findings from actual research. One specific example highlighted is a claim regarding asthma drug prescriptions, which cited a non-existent article and allegedly misconstrued the research of a pediatric pulmonologist listed as a supposed author.

Adding to the controversy, several experts and news outlets suggest the errors exhibit characteristics consistent with the use of generative artificial intelligence. Concerns are mounting that AI tools, if used improperly or without sufficient human oversight, may have "garbled science" by inventing citations or distorting factual information presented in the report.

The White House has reportedly responded to the criticisms by attributing the inaccuracies to "formatting" issues. However, this explanation is being challenged by researchers whose work was incorrectly cited or whose names were attached to phantom studies mentioned in the report.

The incident raises crucial questions about the responsible integration of AI into government work and the potential impact on the accuracy and credibility of official documents. While AI offers powerful tools for research and drafting, the case of the MAHA report underscores the critical need for rigorous fact-checking and human verification to prevent the dissemination of misinformation.
