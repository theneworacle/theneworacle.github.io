Reports suggest President Trump has already signed letters warning countries of the impending tariff increases if negotiations don't accelerate. Bessent described these warnings not as a new deadline for talks, but as a firm implementation date for the higher rates, aiming to spur quicker progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the path to new deals appears more challenging for some. Reports from Europe indicate that EU negotiators have not yet achieved a breakthrough in their discussions with the Trump administration and concessions are needed. Facing the possibility of tariff hikes, they may seek to extend the current trade terms to avoid disruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite some perceived \"foot-dragging\" by trading partners, Bessent predicted a flurry of deals in the coming days as the deadline pressure mounts.
