Fast forward to today, and the streaming giant is embracing the very model it once helped dismantle. In a clear signal of its future direction, Netflix is making a significant two-pronged push into advertising and artificial intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Billion-Dollar Bet on Advertising\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith its ad-supported subscription tier now boasting 94 million users, Netflix is aggressively building out its advertising arm. The company recently launched its own global ad-tech platform, giving it direct control over its ad sales and delivery. According to co-CEO Greg Peters, this new infrastructure, combined with an \"amazing\" content slate, is set to double the company's ad revenue this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it's not just about standard commercials. Netflix is moving into new territory with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInteractive Ads:\u003c/strong\u003e Later this year, viewers can expect to see interactive promotions, a feature already utilized by competitors like Hulu and Amazon Prime Video.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive Sports:\u003c/strong\u003e High-profile live events, including NFL games and a blockbuster boxing match between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford, are being used as major draws for advertisers seeking massive, engaged audiences in real-time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis strategic embrace of advertising is a clear move to monetize the platform's staggering 95 billion hours of engagement from the first half of 2025 alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eEnter the AI Co-Star\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile one side of the business builds an ad empire, the other is quietly integrating generative AI into its production workflow. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that the upcoming Argentinian sci-fi series, \u003cem\u003eEl Eternauta\u003c/em\u003e, features the \"very first GenAI final footage to appear on screen\" in a Netflix production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI was used to create a complex visual effects sequence of a collapsing building. The results, according to Sarandos, were game-changing. \"That VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been... and the cost of it would just not have been feasible for a show in that budget,\" he stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarandos emphasized that the goal is not just to cut costs but to empower filmmakers. \"We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper,\" he said. This move comes after the contentious 2023 Hollywood strikes, where the role of AI in creative industries was a central issue, making Netflix's first step into generative AI a closely watched development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Future is Streamed, Served with Ads, and Made with AI\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix's strategy is a telling indicator of the streaming industry's maturation. The days of growth at any cost are over, replaced by a pragmatic focus on diversified revenue and production efficiency. By building a robust advertising business and harnessing the power of AI, Netflix is not just adapting to the new landscape—it's actively shaping it. The question now is how these changes will redefine the viewing experience for millions around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Netflix Bets on Ads and AI to Shape Its Future","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-18T16:31:04Z","summary":"Once the pioneer of ad-free streaming, Netflix is now executing a major strategy shift, doubling down on its advertising business and integrating generative AI into its production pipeline to cut costs and boost efficiency.","tags":["Netflix","AI","Advertising","Generative AI","Streaming","VFX","El Eternauta"],"sources":[{"url":"https://gizmodo.com/netflix-is-doubling-down-on-ads-and-dabbling-in-ai-2000631347","title":"Netflix Is Doubling Down on Ads and Dabbling in AI"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/technology/artificial-intelligence/netflix-boss-says-show-used-generative-ai-effects-for-first-time/ar-AA1IOD42","title":"Netflix boss says show used generative AI effects for first time"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/technology/artificial-intelligence/is-anything-real-netflix-is-now-using-generative-ai-tools-for-visual-effects/ar-AA1IRoGD","title":"Is Anything Real?
