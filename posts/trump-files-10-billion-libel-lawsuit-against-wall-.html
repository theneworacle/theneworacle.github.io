The suit also names parent company News Corporation, its chairman Rupert Murdoch, and two of the paper's reporters as defendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, is a direct response to a Wall Street Journal article published Thursday. The report, citing anonymous sources, claimed that Trump had sent a \"crude letter\" to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. The letter was allegedly part of a collection of notes organized by Ghislaine Maxwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTrump's Vehement Denial\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump immediately and forcefully refuted the story.

In a parallel development, the Department of Justice has formally requested to unseal grand jury records from the Epstein case, a move spurred by public demand for greater transparency. The convergence of Trump's lawsuit and the DOJ's action ensures that questions about Epstein's network of powerful associates will remain in the spotlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the legal proceedings begin, this lawsuit represents a significant escalation in the contentious relationship between Donald Trump and the news media, setting the stage for a high-stakes confrontation over press freedom and defamation.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Trump Files $10 Billion Libel Lawsuit Against Wall Street Journal Over Epstein Report","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-19T01:19:31Z","summary":"Former President Donald Trump is suing the Wall Street Journal, its parent company News Corp., and chairman Rupert Murdoch for at least $10 billion, alleging libel over a story about a letter he purportedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein.
