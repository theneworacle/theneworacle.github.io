### The Grand Vision: An AI in Every Pair of Glasses

Mark Zuckerberg isn't just thinking about the next version of AI; he's aiming for the ultimate prize: artificial superintelligence. In a recent public letter, the Meta CEO outlined a bold vision for what he calls "personal superintelligence," an AI so advanced it can act as a deeply knowledgeable and personalized assistant for every individual on the planet. 

Zuckerberg imagines this power being accessed not through a keyboard, but through smart glasses that will become our "primary computing devices." This AI would see what we see, hear what we hear, and ultimately help us achieve our personal and professional goals. He frames this as a democratizing force, a tool for "personal empowerment" that contrasts sharply with visions of a centralized AI that automates society and renders humans dependent.

### A Pricey Gambit: The AI Talent War

To turn this science-fiction concept into reality, Meta has declared war. The company has launched the "Meta Superintelligence Labs" (MSL) and is engaged in an aggressive and costly campaign to acquire the brightest minds in the field. 

This isn't just about offering competitive salaries; Meta is reportedly tabling multi-million dollar packages to poach elite researchers from rivals like OpenAI and Google. The recent hiring of Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang to lead the new lab, a move accompanied by a massive investment in his company, signals just how serious Zuckerberg is about winning this race.

### Cracks in the Foundation

However, this aggressive strategy is creating significant turmoil within Meta's own walls. Reports have surfaced of growing friction and tension among the company's existing AI researchers. Some employees who have been with Meta for years feel their treatment is "sub-par" compared to the lavish offers being thrown at outsiders. 

This feeling of being undervalued is reportedly causing rifts and threatening a talent exodus, with some engineers considering offers from competitors like Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI. The high-stakes pursuit of a superintelligent future is, ironically, creating a very human resources problem in the present.
