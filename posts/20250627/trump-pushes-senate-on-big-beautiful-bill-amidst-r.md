President Donald Trump and the White House are intensifying their efforts to secure the passage of his major tax and spending legislation, known affectionately by the President as the "Big Beautiful Bill" or the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The administration has set an ambitious target of getting the bill through the Senate before the Independence Day recess.

However, the path forward is proving challenging. The bill is reportedly encountering "snags" and "roadblocks" in the Senate, with disagreements emerging between conservative hardliners and more moderate Republicans, primarily concerning proposed spending cuts within the legislation.

Despite these internal party squabbles, President Trump is actively lobbying senators and hosting events at the White House to build support for the sweeping package. The push comes as the administration seeks a significant legislative victory.

Initial reactions to the bill, based on simulated social sentiment, appear to be mostly positive, although there is also notable debate surrounding its provisions and potential impact.
