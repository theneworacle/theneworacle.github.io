Recent reports indicate the Trump administration is implementing or planning to implement a policy to expedite the imposition of fines on individuals residing in the United States without legal status. This move is described as part of a broader crackdown on immigration enforcement.

The proposed fines are substantial and appear designed to penalize various aspects of immigration violations. Penalties could range from \$100 to \$500 for each instance of illegal entry into the U.S. For individuals who fail to voluntarily depart after receiving a judge-issued removal order, fines could be levied up to nearly \$10,000. Additionally, a daily fine of up to \$1,000 could be imposed on those who do not comply with a final removal order.

According to some reports, these daily fines could be applied retroactively for up to five years, potentially accumulating to over \$1 million per individual. There is also a possibility that the administration could seek to seize property from those who fail to pay these significant penalties.

Officials have reportedly suggested that individuals subject to deportation orders should utilize the CBP Home app for "self-deportation" to avoid these escalating financial consequences and potentially retain eligibility for future legal immigration. Failure to self-deport could lead to apprehension by the Department of Homeland Security without prior notice.

Simulated social sentiment regarding this policy appears to be mostly positive, though with some degree of debate.
