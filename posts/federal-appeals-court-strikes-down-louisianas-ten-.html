A unanimous three-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's ruling, declaring the law \"plainly unconstitutional.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe law, which took effect on January 1st, was a key legislative priority for the state's Republican-controlled government, including Governor Jeff Landry and his supporters who argued it reflected America's historical and religious values. However, a multi-faith coalition of parents challenged the mandate, asserting it violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which prohibits government endorsement of religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe appeals court judges agreed, stating that forcing students to be subjected to government-sponsored religious displays infringed upon their First Amendment rights. The ruling emphasized that there is no option for students to avoid this exposure throughout their public education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis decision aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court's 1980 ruling in \u003cem\u003eStone v. Graham\u003c/em\u003e, which struck down a similar Kentucky statute. The 5th Circuit panel explicitly rejected Louisiana's argument that the 1980 precedent was no longer applicable following a more recent Supreme Court case concerning prayer by a football coach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill has expressed strong disagreement with the ruling and intends to appeal the decision, first to the full 5th Circuit Court and potentially to the U.S. Supreme Court. Despite the legal challenge being deemed premature by state attorneys initially, the court proceeded, solidifying the preliminary injunction against enforcing the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ruling comes amidst a broader national conversation about the role of religion in public life and education. While supporters see the law as a return to traditional values, opponents argue it undermines the religious freedom of students and families from diverse backgrounds. Social media sentiment regarding the ruling appears to be largely positive, though debate on the issue continues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, the federal appeals court's decision prevents the state from implementing the classroom display mandate, pending any further appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Federal Appeals Court Strikes Down Louisiana's Ten Commandments Classroom Law","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-21T12:29:15Z","summary":"A federal appeals court has unanimously ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms is unconstitutional, upholding a lower court's decision and reigniting the national debate over the separation of church and state.","tags":["Louisiana","Ten Commandments","First Amendment","Religious Freedom","Education","Court Ruling","Separation of Church and State"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/court-blocks-louisiana-law-requiring-schools-to-post-ten-commandments-in-classrooms/ar-AA1H7tHL","title":"Court blocks Louisiana law requiring schools to post Ten Commandments in classrooms"},{"url":"https://www.nola.com/news/education/louisiana-ten-commandments-law-unconstitutional-fifth-circuit/article_7cf2f7a8-8225-4abd-9836-6a0eb3c65afa.html","title":"Louisiana’s Ten Commandments law is unconstitutional, federal appeals court rules"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/court-blocks-louisiana-law-requiring-schools-to-post-ten-commandments-in-classrooms/ar-AA1H9o08","title":"Court blocks Louisiana law requiring schools to post Ten Commandments in classrooms"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/louisiana-s-ten-commandments-law-struck-down-by-us-appeals-court/ar-AA1H7LVc","title":"Louisiana's Ten Commandments law struck down by US appeals court"},{"url":"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/federal-appeals-court-upholds-block-on-louisiana-ten-commandments-display-law/2025/06","title":"Federal Appeals Court Upholds Block on Louisiana Ten Commandments Display Law"},{"url":"https://ijr.com/court-strikes-down-louisiana-law-requiring-ten-commandments-in-schools/","title":"Court Strikes Down Louisiana Law Requiring Ten Commandments In Schools"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-louisianas-ten-"},"buildId":"paS3nbBROfXCejjC3IBgF","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
