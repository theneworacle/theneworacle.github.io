The U.S. Treasury Department has officially unveiled its plan to end the production of the penny coin, a move driven primarily by the simple fact that it costs more to make than it's worth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Treasury's announcement, the U.S. Mint has placed its final order for the metal blanks used to strike pennies. Once these blanks are used up, manufacturing will cease. While estimates suggest no new pennies will enter circulation by early next year, the billions of pennies already in existence will remain legal tender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe practical effect for consumers will be a shift in cash transactions. Without pennies for exact change, cash prices will soon be rounded up or down to the nearest five cents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis decision follows a bipartisan push to eliminate the lowest-denomination coin due to increasing production costs. In fiscal year 2024, it cost approximately 3.7 cents to produce a single penny. This situation, where the cost of minting exceeds the face value, is known as negative seigniorage and has been a long-standing point of debate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe move was supported by figures including President Trump, who framed it as a budget-cutting measure. It has also received backing from advocates for government efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the economics of the change aren't entirely straightforward. The USA Today report highlights that while pennies are costly, nickels are significantly more expensive to produce, costing about 13.8 cents each in FY2024. The potential increase in nickel production could partially offset or even negate the savings gained from ditching the penny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePennies have a long history in the U.S., being among the first coins minted over 230 years ago. Despite their low value, they were produced in massive quantities, with about 3.2 billion made in FY2024 alone. An estimated 114 billion pennies are currently in circulation nationwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe United States isn't alone in this decision. Several other countries, including Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, have already discontinued their lowest-denomination coins, implementing similar rounding systems for cash transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimulated social sentiment regarding the change appears to be mostly positive, with many viewing the penny as a nuisance or obsolete. However, some debate likely exists, perhaps around historical significance or the practical implications of rounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the U.S. Mint winds down production, the era of the penny is drawing to a close, ushering in a future where making exact change with physical currency becomes a little simpler, even if the cost savings aren't as clear-cut as they first appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Making Cents of Change: US Treasury Plans to End Penny Production","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-22T18:17:09Z","summary":"The U.S. Treasury Department has announced plans to cease production of the one-cent coin, citing rising costs.
