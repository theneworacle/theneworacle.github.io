However, internal benchmarks released by the company suggest that these models are currently underperforming when compared to established models from competing tech firms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core findings from the benchmarks indicate that Apple's \"Apple On-Device\" model, designed for offline processing, was rated by human testers as only \"comparably\" good, not better, than similarly-sized models from Google and Alibaba for text generation. Furthermore, the more powerful \"Apple Server\" model, intended for cloud-based operations, was rated behind OpenAI's GPT-4o, a model that is already a year old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn image analysis tests, the results were similar, with Meta's Llama 4 Scout model being preferred by human raters over Apple Server. This performance data seems to lend support to ongoing reports suggesting that Apple's AI research and development efforts have struggled to keep pace in the intensely competitive artificial intelligence landscape. Past issues, such as a delayed Siri upgrade and lawsuits over AI features, have also contributed to this perception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnically, the Apple On-Device model is approximately 3 billion parameters, optimized for features like summarization and text analysis on devices like the iPhone. The larger Apple Server model operates in Apple's data centers. Apple claims both models show improvements in tool use and efficiency and can understand around 15 languages, benefiting from an expanded training dataset that includes diverse content types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile benchmarks provide one perspective, other reports highlight different angles. Some Apple research points to perceived weaknesses in competitor models, suggesting they \"fail at hard reasoning\" on certain complex tasks. Additionally, Apple has reportedly framed its models as being \"nearly as good\" as competitors in some contexts, citing specific benchmark percentages, such as a lower rate of generating harmful content compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo. Apple has also engaged in pushing more open-source AI models, though these appear to be research projects rather than the core models powering Apple Intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublic reaction, as suggested by simulated social sentiment, appears \"mostly positive, some debate.\" This indicates that user reception might not be solely dictated by raw performance benchmarks, possibly factoring in the overall user experience and integration into Apple's ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, while Apple is clearly integrating AI deeply into its products and making efforts in model development and safety, the benchmark data presents a clear challenge: closing the performance gap with current AI leaders. This sets a critical task for Apple as it navigates the rapidly evolving future of artificial intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Apple's upgraded AI models underwhelm on performance","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-10T16:29:10Z","summary":"Apple's latest AI models, powering its new Apple Intelligence features, appear to underperform compared to older models from rivals like OpenAI and Meta, according to the company's own benchmark data.","tags":["AI","Apple","Benchmarks","Machine Learning","Tech","Artificial Intelligence","WWDC"],"sources":[{"url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/apples-upgraded-ai-models-underwhelm-on-performance/","title":"Appleâ€™s upgraded AI models underwhelm on performance"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/apple-claims-ai-reasoning-models-collapse-and-quit-easily-as-tim-cook-faces-wwdc-without-a-new-product/ar-AA1GmDjF","title":"Apple claims AI reasoning models 'collapse' and quit easily as Tim Cook faces WWDC without a new product"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/news/apple-research-claims-popular-ai-models-fail-at-hard-reasoning-why-does-it-matter/ar-AA1GlOVn","title":"Apple research claims popular AI models fail at hard reasoning: Why does it matter?"},{"url":"https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-foundation-models-vs-chatgpt-3450620/","title":"Apple reveals its AI models are nearly as good as ChatGPT, other competitors"},{"url":"https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/21/apple-keeps-pushing-ai-industry-forward-with-more-open-source-models","title":"Apple keeps pushing AI industry forward with more open-source models"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"apples-upgraded-ai-models-underwhelm-on-performanc"},"buildId":"wdWONiehFmup9f1L26GsK","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
