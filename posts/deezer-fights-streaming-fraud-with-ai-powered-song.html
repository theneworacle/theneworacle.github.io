This initiative is aimed at fighting streaming fraud, which the company says is being driven by the misuse of AI tools to generate music and claim royalties illicitly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeezer, while a smaller player compared to giants like Spotify and Apple Music, sees this as an industry-wide problem. According to the company, AI-generated music now accounts for a substantial portion of daily uploads—18%, or about 20,000 tracks, a sharp increase from just 10% three months prior. While fully AI-generated music represents a small fraction of total streams (around 0.5%), Deezer suspects that up to 70% of streams for these tracks come from streaming farms or bots, indicating fraud is a primary motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo combat this, Deezer will display an on-screen label warning of \"AI-generated content.\" The company is leveraging AI itself to detect these tracks, analyzing patterns in the music generated by the same AI tools used to create the songs. This necessitates constant updates to their detection algorithms as the patterns change, essentially fighting AI with AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe move comes amidst broader industry debates and legal challenges surrounding generative AI and copyright. Several popular AI song generators, such as Suno and Udio, are facing lawsuits from record companies and royalty-collection groups over alleged copyright infringement and the use of existing artists' work without permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeezer's action highlights the increasing disruption caused by generative AI in the creative industries and the critical need to safeguard the rights of artists and songwriters. The company is committed to cutting off royalty payments for any AI songs found to be used for stream manipulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe public reaction to Deezer's announcement appears to be mostly positive, with some ongoing discussion, suggesting that many see this as a necessary step to ensure fair play and protect the integrity of the music streaming ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Deezer Fights Streaming Fraud with AI-Powered Song Tags","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-21T04:27:07Z","summary":"Music streaming service Deezer is introducing AI-generated content labels on albums as part of a new strategy to combat fraudulent streams and protect artist royalties in the age of generative AI.","tags":["AI","Music Streaming","Fraud","Deezer","Copyright","Artificial Intelligence","Music Industry"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/06/20/ai-music-song-tags/","title":"Music streaming service Deezer adds AI song tags in fight against fraud"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/music/news/music-streaming-service-deezer-adds-ai-song-tags-in-fight-against-fraud/ar-AA1H5rre","title":"Music streaming service Deezer adds AI song tags in fight against fraud"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/deezer-starts-labeling-ai-generated-music-to-tackle-streaming-fraud/ar-AA1H7eNG","title":"Deezer starts labeling AI-generated music to tackle streaming fraud"},{"url":"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/deezer-rolls-out-ai-tagging-system-to-fight-streaming-fraud-says-up-to-70-of-streams-from-fully-ai-generated-tracks-are-fraudulent/","title":"Deezer rolls out AI tagging system to fight streaming fraud; says up to 70% of streams from fully AI-generated tracks are fraudulent"},{"url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/culture/deezer-ai-songs-tags-fraud-b2774092.html","title":"Music streaming service adds tags to AI-generated songs so listeners will know"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/technology/artificial-intelligence/deezer-becomes-first-streamer-to-tag-ai-music-18-of-all-uploaded-music-is-now-ai/ar-AA1H43kp","title":"Deezer Becomes First Streamer to Tag AI Music—18% of All Uploaded Music Is Now AI"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"deezer-fights-streaming-fraud-with-ai-powered-song"},"buildId":"inve4hyZSM1kRD8EEwN0X","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
