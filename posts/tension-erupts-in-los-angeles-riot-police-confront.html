As night fell, demonstrators gathered to voice their opposition to the federal operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation escalated into a stand-off, with helmeted police in riot gear lining streets, equipped with batons and what appeared to be tear gas rifles. Authorities ordered the crowds to disperse, declaring an unlawful assembly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVideo and reports from the scene show police deploying tear gas, pepper spray, and \"flash-bang\" concussion rounds to disperse the crowds.
