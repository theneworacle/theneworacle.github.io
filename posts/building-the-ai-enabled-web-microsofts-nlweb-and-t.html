Finding information wasn't always easy. That challenge led to the creation of standards like RSS and Atom, making it simpler for humans to find and syndicate content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, with the rise of sophisticated AI models and agents, we face a similar challenge: making the vast amount of information on the web easily accessible and understandable for artificial intelligence. This is sparking a new wave of protocol development, and Microsoft is jumping into the fray with its open-source \u003cstrong\u003eNLWeb (natural language web)\u003c/strong\u003e effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnounced at the Build 2025 conference, NLWeb has a notable connection to web history – it was conceived by RV Guha, a key figure behind foundational standards like RSS, RDF, and schema.org.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is NLWeb and Why Does it Matter?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core idea behind NLWeb is simple yet powerful: enable websites to easily add AI-powered conversational interfaces. Think of it as turning any website into an \"AI app\" where users (both human and AI agents) can query content using natural language instead of just clicking through menus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft CTO Kevin Scott described it as potentially the \"HTML for the agentic web,\" suggesting its fundamental role in how AI interacts with online information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow NLWeb Works\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNLWeb is designed to build upon the web's existing infrastructure rather than demanding a complete overhaul. It works by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeveraging Existing Data:\u003c/strong\u003e It starts with structured data already present on websites, such as schema.org markup, RSS feeds, and other formats commonly embedded in pages.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProcessing and Storing Data:\u003c/strong\u003e Tools within the NLWeb system help add this structured data to vector databases, enabling efficient semantic search and retrieval.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAI Enhancement:\u003c/strong\u003e Large Language Models (LLMs) are then used to enhance this stored data with external knowledge and context, providing richer, more intelligent responses than simple data retrieval.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreating a Universal Interface:\u003c/strong\u003e The output is a natural language interface, allowing users to ask questions and receive conversational answers, while AI systems can access and query the data programmatically.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach allows websites to become participants in the emerging agentic web without requiring massive technical investments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNLWeb's Place in the AI Protocol Landscape\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe article highlights that NLWeb isn't necessarily competing with other emerging protocols like Google's Agent2Agent (focused on agent-to-agent communication) or LLMs.txt (designed to help LLM crawlers ingest content). Instead, it builds upon them. Notably, each NLWeb instance can function as a \u003cstrong\u003eModel Control Protocol (MCP)\u003c/strong\u003e server, an open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources that is gaining traction as a foundational layer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAdvantages for Enterprises\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor businesses, NLWeb presents several potential benefits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter AI Interpretation:\u003c/strong\u003e Gives AI systems more precise control and understanding of website components, reducing errors.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReduced Rework:\u003c/strong\u003e Could minimize the need to constantly adapt website interfaces for AI.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeveraging Existing Investments:\u003c/strong\u003e Capitalizes on the structured data websites are often already creating for SEO and other purposes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnhanced Internal AI:\u003c/strong\u003e Makes internal company information more accessible to internal LLMs and AI agents.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImproved External Engagement:\u003c/strong\u003e Transforms public-facing websites into dynamic, conversational resources.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eEarly Adoption and Outlook\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft has already engaged several prominent organizations as early adopters, including Allrecipes, Eventbrite, O’Reilly Media, Tripadvisor, and Shopify. This demonstrates real-world interest and application across different sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly feedback suggests NLWeb is valuable for both consuming public information and publishing private information internally. The implementation is described as potentially not a heavy lift, especially for organizations already using relevant standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile still early days, the general sentiment around NLWeb appears mostly positive, reflecting the growing recognition of the need for the web to become truly AI-friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNLWeb represents a significant step in the evolution of the web, aiming to bridge the gap between human-centric design and the needs of the burgeoning AI agent ecosystem. As the battle to AI-enable the web continues, initiatives like NLWeb will be crucial in shaping how we, and our AI assistants, interact with online information in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Building the AI-Enabled Web: Microsoft's NLWeb and the Future of Online Interaction","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-25T05:18:40Z","summary":"As AI agents become more sophisticated, the web needs to evolve to speak their language.
