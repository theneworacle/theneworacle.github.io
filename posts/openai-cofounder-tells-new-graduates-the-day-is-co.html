Previously, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap reportedly suggested that AGI could be reached within the next four years. Similarly, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar has spoken about the company's efforts to create AI that can handle tasks that professionals, such as software engineers, find undesirable, effectively multiplying human capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prospect of AI reaching such a level of capability naturally raises questions about the future of work and the potential for significant societal shifts. While some view this as an opportunity for unprecedented productivity and innovation, others express concerns about job displacement and the need for individuals and industries to adapt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimulated social sentiment surrounding such predictions appears to be largely positive, reflecting excitement about AI's potential, though it's accompanied by notable debate regarding the broader implications for employment and how society will navigate a future intertwined with increasingly capable AI systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs AI research and development accelerate, statements like Sutskever's serve as powerful reminders of the transformative potential of this technology and the important conversations we need to continue having about its integration into our lives and the workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"OpenAI cofounder tells new graduates the day is coming when AI 'will do all the things that we can'","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-09T16:29:46Z","summary":"A leading figure at OpenAI predicts a future where artificial intelligence can perform tasks currently exclusive to humans, sparking discussions about the rapid advancement of AI and its potential impact on the future of work and society.","tags":["AI","AGI","OpenAI","Future of Work","Technology","Innovation","Jobs","Artificial Intelligence"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/openai-cofounder-tells-new-graduates-the-day-is-coming-when-ai-will-do-all-the-things-that-we-can/ar-AA1Gntbb","title":"OpenAI cofounder tells new graduates the day is coming when AI 'will do all the things that we can'"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/humans-have-4-years-before-ai-can-do-everything-they-can-do-openai-coo-says/ar-AA1FJLwV","title":"Humans Have 4 Years Before AI Can Do Everything They Can Do, OpenAI COO Says"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/openai-is-creating-ai-to-do-all-the-things-that-software-engineers-hate-to-do/ar-AA1CYVYI","title":"OpenAI Is Creating AI to Do 'All the Things That Software Engineers Hate to Do'"},{"url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-non-profit-control-public-benefit-corporation-sam-altman-letter-2025-5","title":"OpenAI appears to have decided that transferring control away from its nonprofit isn't worth the hassle after all."},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-in/health/medical/openai-s-former-head-of-agi-readiness-says-that-soon-ai-will-be-able-to-do-anything-on-a-computer-that-a-human-can/ar-AA1toIZy","title":"OpenAI's former head of 'AGI readiness' says that soon AI will be able to do anything on a computer that a human can"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"openai-cofounder-tells-new-graduates-the-day-is-co"},"buildId":"lMZsSHy_roMStNaGr7p2P","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
