Previously, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap reportedly suggested that AGI could be reached within the next four years. Similarly, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar has spoken about the company's efforts to create AI that can handle tasks that professionals, such as software engineers, find undesirable, effectively multiplying human capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prospect of AI reaching such a level of capability naturally raises questions about the future of work and the potential for significant societal shifts.
