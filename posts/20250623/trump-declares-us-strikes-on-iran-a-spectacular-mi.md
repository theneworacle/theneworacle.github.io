In a significant development regarding U.S. foreign policy, former President Donald Trump addressed the nation from the White House following U.S. military strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities. Trump described the operation as a "spectacular military success," highlighting the precision and effectiveness of the strikes.

The former president's address emphasized a clear message to Iran: make peace or face the possibility of "far greater" attacks. He warned that any further U.S. action would be carried out with "speed" and "precision." Among the reported targets of the strikes was the Fordo nuclear facility.

The statement comes amidst ongoing tensions in the region and underscores a firm stance from the former administration regarding Iran's nuclear program and regional activities.

Simulated social sentiment surrounding Trump's declaration appears to be mostly positive, though some debate on the issue is present.
