Users suspect that the AI algorithms are mistakenly flagging innocent activity or content, leading to automated bans without human review or a clear path to appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of these mass bans is significant, affecting not only personal accounts but also businesses and creators who rely on the platform for their livelihood and audience connection. The lack of transparency around the bans and the perceived errors in the AI system are fueling user anger and distrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Meta, Instagram's parent company, has remained publicly silent on this specific wave of bans, the issue highlights the ongoing challenges in implementing large-scale AI moderation effectively.
