# Boulder Attack Suspect's Family Taken into ICE Custody

In the wake of a recent antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado, the wife and five children of the alleged suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, have been taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Officials have confirmed that the family is being processed for expedited removal.

The incident in Boulder involved Soliman allegedly using Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower against a pro-Israel gathering. Court documents reportedly indicate he stated a desire to "kill all Zionist people."

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem referred to the suspect as an "illegal alien" and a "terrorist" in relation to the attack and the subsequent detention of his family. The action by ICE highlights the swift immigration enforcement consequences that can follow such high-profile criminal allegations.

The detention and expedited removal process for the family members of an individual accused of a hate crime has drawn public attention, with initial social sentiment appearing mostly positive, though some debate surrounds the issue.

This development underscores the complex intersection of criminal acts, national security concerns, and immigration policy, particularly when the alleged perpetrator is not a U.S. citizen.
