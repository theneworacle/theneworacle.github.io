Hailed by CEO Sam Altman as having \"Ph.D-level\" expertise, the new model is not just an incremental update; it's a fundamental shift in how users will interact with AI. Described as the company's \"smartest, fastest and most useful model yet,\" GPT-5 is now rolling out to all users, including those on the free tier, marking a pivotal moment in the accessibility of advanced AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Smarter System: No More Choosing Models\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most significant change for the everyday user is the introduction of a \u003cstrong\u003eunified system with an automatic router\u003c/strong\u003e. Gone are the days of manually selecting the right tool for the job.

A \"Superpower\" for Coding and Agentic Tasks\u003c/strong\u003e\nAltman called GPT-5's advanced coding ability its \"superpower.\" The model has demonstrated a stunning capacity for agentic tasks, successfully building a fully functional and interactive web application from a simple text prompt in under five minutes during a press demo. It achieves state-of-the-art scores on complex coding benchmarks, signaling a new era for AI-assisted software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. More Accurate, More Honest\u003c/strong\u003e\nAddressing one of the biggest criticisms of previous models, OpenAI has made significant strides in reducing inaccuracies. GPT-5's responses are reportedly \u003cstrong\u003e80% less likely to contain a factual error than the o3 model\u003c/strong\u003e. Even more importantly, the model is designed to be more honest. Instead of generating a plausible-sounding but incorrect answer, it will now more readily admit when it cannot perform a task or doesn't know the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.
