In a significant policy shift, the U.S. State Department has announced a temporary halt to the scheduling of new visa interviews for foreign students. The directive, issued under the Trump administration, is reportedly being put in place to allow for the expansion of social media screening procedures for visa applicants.

This move means that international students hoping to study in the United States will face delays in the visa application process as U.S. embassies worldwide pause new appointments. The expanded social media vetting is intended to provide officials with a more comprehensive understanding of applicants' online presence and activities.

The policy change has been confirmed by multiple news outlets and is being viewed as the latest in a series of measures by the administration aimed at tightening restrictions on international students and visitors. While the full scope and duration of the pause remain unclear, it is expected to impact thousands of prospective students.

Simulated social media sentiment surrounding this decision indicates a predominantly positive reaction from some segments, while others are raising concerns and engaging in debate about the implications of expanded government surveillance on potential students and the future of international education in the U.S.
