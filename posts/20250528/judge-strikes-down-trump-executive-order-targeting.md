In a significant development, a federal judge has struck down an executive order issued by President Donald Trump earlier this year that specifically targeted the prominent law firm WilmerHale.

The ruling, handed down on Tuesday, declares the executive order unconstitutional and permanently blocks the administration from enforcing it. This decision marks the latest in a series of setbacks for the Trump administration's attempts to use executive action against major law firms perceived as acting against its interests.

According to multiple news reports, this is at least the third time a federal judge has issued a similar ruling against one of President Trump's executive orders aimed at law firms. The consistent judicial response highlights a pattern of courts finding these targeted actions to be in violation of constitutional principles.

While the specific details of the executive order's unconstitutionality were not fully available in the research materials, the pattern of rulings suggests that judges are finding these orders to overstep the bounds of executive authority and potentially infringe upon the rights of the targeted firms.

The news has reportedly garnered a mostly positive reaction on social media, though with some debate, reflecting the polarized views surrounding the administration's use of executive power and its relationship with legal institutions.
