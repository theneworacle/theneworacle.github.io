The decision expands on a previous, more limited order, now offering protection to all of the organization's affiliates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe controversial provision was part of a major tax and spending package recently signed into law by President Donald Trump. The law sought to pause Medicaid reimbursements for one year to centers that offer abortion services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her ruling, Judge Talwani stated that Planned Parenthood is likely to succeed in its claim that the law's targeted exclusion of the organization violates the U.S. Constitution. The judge found that the provision amounted to a “targeted exclusion” of the healthcare provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlanned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson praised the decision in a statement, saying the order ensures “patients across the country can still go to their trusted Planned Parenthood provider for care using Medicaid.” The organization had warned that the funding cuts would force clinic closures and severely limit community access to essential services like low-cost contraception, STI testing, and cancer screenings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has already appealed the judge's initial order, signaling that the legal battle is far from over.
