We type a question, and a large language model provides an answer. But the limitations of this model are becoming clear. The next great leap for AI isn't about having a better conversation; it's about taking action. Welcome to the era of \"agentic AI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously perform complex, multi-step tasks on a user's behalf. Think of an AI that doesn't just tell you the best flight options, but actually books the ticket, reserves the hotel, and adds it to your calendar. And the natural habitat for these powerful new agents is the one tool we all use to interface with the digital world: the web browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Browser: The New AI Battlefield\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe browser is the gateway to the internet's vast landscape of information and applications. By integrating directly into it, AI can move beyond its siloed chat window to interact with the web just like a human would—only much faster. This evolution is sparking a new wave of innovation and competition, with startups and tech giants alike racing to build the first true AI-native browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePerplexity's Comet: The Ambitious Challenger\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI startup Perplexity is making a bold move with its new AI-powered browser, \"Comet.\" Far more than just a search engine, Comet is a complete browser designed to actively use AI to interact with web content. It can summarize articles, pull data from multiple open tabs to answer complex questions, and is being developed to perform tasks for the user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerplexity's ambition is clear. The well-funded startup is already in talks with mobile phone manufacturers to have Comet pre-installed on new devices, a direct and aggressive strategy to chip away at Google Chrome's market dominance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eOpenAI's Agent: The Chatbot That Can Do\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot to be outdone, OpenAI is evolving its signature product with a powerful new feature called \"ChatGPT Agent.\" Available to its premium users, this feature gives ChatGPT the ability to control its own sandboxed web browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsers can now ask ChatGPT to perform complex tasks that require navigating multiple websites, running code, and creating documents. From planning and purchasing a new wardrobe for an event to generating a PowerPoint presentation based on web research, the agent works autonomously while the user watches and retains the ability to intervene. It represents a fundamental shift from a tool that finds information to a tool that \u003cem\u003euses\u003c/em\u003e information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Paradigm Shift for the Internet\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis trend represents the most significant threat to Google's search and browser empire in decades. The user interaction model is changing from manually searching, clicking, and compiling information to simply giving a command to a capable AI agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the public reaction has been a mix of excitement for the \"future of the internet\" and some skepticism about high-priced premium tiers and the technology's current reliability, the direction of travel is undeniable. The browser is no longer just a window to the web; it's becoming an intelligent, active partner in navigating it. Keep an eye on this space—the way we experience the internet is about to fundamentally change.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Why AI Is Moving From Chatbots to the Browser","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-19T08:30:37Z","summary":"The familiar chatbot window is expanding.
