The law, reportedly part of a broader legislative package, is said to include provisions that would block the enforcement of AI regulations at the state level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach immediately raises red flags regarding states' rights, a core principle of the U.S. constitutional system.
