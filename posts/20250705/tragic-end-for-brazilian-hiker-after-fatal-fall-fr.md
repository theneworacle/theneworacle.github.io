A forensic specialist indicated that blunt force trauma, causing significant internal organ damage and bone fractures, was the cause of death. The examination revealed multiple injuries and abrasions, consistent with striking objects during her descent.

The news of Juliana Marins' death has drawn significant attention, with social media sentiment reflecting a mix of sympathy for the young hiker and her family, alongside some discussion regarding the inherent risks involved in challenging hikes and climbs.
