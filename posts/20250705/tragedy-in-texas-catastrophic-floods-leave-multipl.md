Central Texas is grappling with the aftermath of catastrophic flooding triggered by torrential rains. The situation is dire, with authorities confirming multiple fatalities and a frantic search ongoing for missing persons, including a group of children from a local summer camp.

Initial reports indicated at least six deaths, but the toll has sadly risen to at least 13. Among the most concerning aspects of the disaster is the fate of over 20 children who were at a summer camp in the affected area and are currently unaccounted for.

Emergency responders, utilizing both boats and helicopters, are tirelessly conducting search and rescue missions in the fast-moving floodwaters. The sudden and intense nature of the rainfall, with a month's worth falling in just hours in some places, overwhelmed rivers like the Guadalupe, leading to widespread devastation.

The community is reeling from the tragedy, and the number of fatalities is feared to increase as search efforts continue. The focus remains on locating the missing children and providing aid to those affected by the widespread destruction.
