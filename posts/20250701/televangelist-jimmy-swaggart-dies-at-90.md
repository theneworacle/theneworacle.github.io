Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, a towering figure in Pentecostal preaching and a pioneer of televised ministry, has died at the age of 90.

Swaggart, who built a multimillion-dollar media empire reaching millions globally, passed away weeks after being hospitalized following a cardiac arrest on June 15th. His death was widely reported, with many news outlets referencing the scandals that significantly impacted his ministry in the late 1980s.

Known for his passionate, fire-and-brimstone style of preaching, Swaggart's career took a dramatic turn after public revelations of his encounters with prostitutes. These scandals led to a temporary defrocking by the Assemblies of God and a loss of credibility for his ministry.

Despite the controversies, Swaggart continued his televised ministry and maintained a following. His death has prompted varied reactions, with simulated social media sentiment indicating mostly positive reflections mixed with some debate surrounding his complex legacy.

He is survived by his wife, Frances, son, Donnie, and grandchildren.
