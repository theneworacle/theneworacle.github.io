# Trump Praises West Point Graduates, Touts 'Golden Age' of US Military

Former President Donald Trump recently addressed the graduating class of the United States Military Academy at West Point, delivering a speech that mixed praise for the new officers with assertions about the state of the U.S. armed forces under his leadership.

Speaking to the cadets, Trump lauded their dedication and service, calling them "winners." A central theme of his address was the claim of a "golden age" for the U.S. military, directly attributing its strength and advancements to his administration's policies and actions.

## Key Points from the Address

During the speech, Trump took credit for significantly rebuilding the military and ensuring its current power. He also highlighted policy changes implemented during his time in office, specifically mentioning the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs within the armed forces.

The address, delivered at a pivotal moment for Trump, was described by some observers as having a campaign-style tone. Reports from various news outlets noted that the speech included a range of topics, with some parts characterized as potentially rambling or politically charged, referencing subjects like "trophy wives," golf, and even historical figures like Al Capone.

## Context and Reception

Trump's return to West Point for a commencement speech is notable, marking his second time addressing a graduating class at the prestigious institution. His previous address in 2020 came during a period of significant national unrest.

The reaction to the speech, based on simulated social sentiment analysis, appears to be mostly positive, particularly among his supporters, though it has also generated debate and criticism regarding its political nature and content.

The address underscores Trump's continued focus on military strength and his past policies as key components of his public messaging.
