As President Donald Trump continues to publicly voice his displeasure with the Federal Reserve's policies, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly stepped in with a steady hand, privately advising the president against taking the unprecedented step of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSources indicate that Bessent has carefully laid out the potential consequences of such a move. His case centers on the significant risks to the economy, which could be destabilized by the mere perception of political interference in the central bank's operations. Beyond the economic fallout, Bessent also highlighted the potential for serious legal and political obstacles, urging a course of caution and stability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMarkets on Edge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe financial world is watching this development with bated breath. The independence of the Federal Reserve is a cornerstone of global economic confidence in the United States. Financial analysts have warned that an attempt to oust a sitting Fed Chair could trigger a \"revolt in global markets.\" The potential for a sharp downturn in the value of the dollar and U.S. bonds is a scenario that leaders are keen to avoid. This reinforces the gravity of Bessent's private counsel, as maintaining market stability is paramount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Tale of Two Messages\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis quiet, cautionary advice stands in stark contrast to President Trump's public rhetoric. The President has not been shy about his criticism of Powell, recently stating that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" He has even publicly floated the idea of Bessent himself as a potential replacement for the Fed Chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis creates a complex dynamic: while the President applies public pressure, his own Treasury Secretary is working behind the scenes to prevent a move that could unravel economic confidence. For now, Bessent's advice appears to be holding, providing a crucial check on a potentially volatile situation and highlighting the delicate balance between political pressure and the institutional independence of the nation's central bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"The Steady Hand: Why Treasury Secretary Bessent Advised Trump Against Firing Fed Chair Powell","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-19T20:19:07Z","summary":"Amidst public criticism from President Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has privately made the case against the unprecedented move of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, citing significant economic and political risks.","tags":["Donald Trump","Scott Bessent","Jerome Powell","Federal Reserve","US Economy","Economic Policy"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/how-bessent-made-the-case-to-trump-against-firing-fed-chair-powell/ar-AA1IUJrU","title":"How Bessent Made the Case to Trump Against Firing Fed Chair Powell"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-bessent-an-option-to-replace-fed-chair-but-i-like-the-job-hes-doing/ar-AA1IGbQ6","title":"Trump: Bessent an option to replace Fed chair, 'but I like the job he's doing'"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/markets-could-freak-out-if-trump-tries-to-fire-powell/ar-AA1IJ87Q","title":"Markets could freak out if Trump tries to fire Powell"},{"url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/17/business/trump-blasts-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-says-his-termination-cannot-come-fast-enough/","title":"Trump blasts Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, says his ‘termination cannot come fast enough!’"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"the-steady-hand-why-treasury-secretary-bessent-adv"},"buildId":"si_Uz8RhO1XEA4SAlYvdk","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
