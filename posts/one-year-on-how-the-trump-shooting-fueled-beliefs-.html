One year ago, an attacker opened fire, tragically killing 50-year-old firefighter Corey Comperatore and wounding two others, while a bullet also struck Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor many of Trump's supporters, the image of a bloodied but defiant Trump being rushed from the stage became more than just a symbol of resilience. It solidified a belief that he was \"saved for a reason,\" protected by \"God's protection,\" or that his survival was a direct sign of \"divine intervention.\" This perspective has become deeply embedded in the MAGA movement's ideology, supercharging the idea of a 'divine right' underpinning Trump's political path and second term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis framing suggests a providential mandate behind Trump's leadership, portraying opposition not just as political disagreement, but as working against a divinely appointed figure. This narrative continues to influence his rhetoric and how his followers perceive his role and the political landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this religious interpretation is widely shared among his base, it also sparks debate among the broader public and political observers. Regardless of viewpoint, the lasting impact of the shooting and the subsequent narrative of divine protection remain a significant factor in the dynamics of the MAGA movement one year after the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"One Year On: How the Trump Shooting Fueled Beliefs in a Divine Right of MAGA","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-13T20:17:15Z","summary":"Explore the narrative among Donald Trump's supporters that his survival of a 2024 assassination attempt was divine intervention, and how this belief is shaping the MAGA movement and his political messaging one year later.","tags":["Trump","MAGA","Shooting","Anniversary","Politics","Religion","Divine Intervention","US News"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/how-the-trump-shooting-supercharged-beliefs-in-a-divine-right-of-maga/ar-AA1Ivfrp","title":"How the Trump shooting supercharged beliefs in a divine right of MAGA"},{"url":"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/assassination-attempt-trump-butler-anniversary-religious/","title":"One Year After Assassination Attempt, MAGA Reiterates \"God Spared Trump\""},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/one-year-from-the-butler-assassination-attempt-how-it-changed-the-2024-race-the-maga-movement-and-trump-himself/ar-AA1Ivt3o","title":"One year from the Butler assassination attempt: How it changed the 2024 race, the MAGA movement and Trump himself"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/one-year-after-shooting-trump-s-base-credits-god-s-protection/ar-AA1Iwsgd","title":"One year after shooting, Trump's base credits God's protection"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/saved-for-a-reason-how-trumps-second-term-is-full-of-assassination-attempt-reminders/ar-AA1IvfkH","title":"'Saved for a reason': How Trump's second term is full of assassination attempt reminders"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/zealous-self-belief-how-the-2024-assassination-attempt-made-trump-reckless/ar-AA1IvMEy","title":"'Zealous self-belief': How the 2024 assassination attempt made Trump 'reckless'"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"one-year-on-how-the-trump-shooting-fueled-beliefs-"},"buildId":"S8sv3KjP1_D2mZUoLOcs0","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
