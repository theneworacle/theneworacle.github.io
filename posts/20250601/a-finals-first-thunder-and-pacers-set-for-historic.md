The stage is set for the NBA Finals, and it's a matchup that's already making history. The Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers are slated to battle it out for the championship, with Game 1 tipping off on Thursday night.

This series marks a significant moment for the league, as it's the first time the NBA Finals will feature two teams that are not considered luxury taxpayers. The Pacers ranked 18th and the Thunder 25th in team payroll this season, highlighting two organizations built through shrewd drafting, development, and strategic moves rather than relying on massive spending.

For the Indiana Pacers, this appearance is a long-awaited return to the NBA's biggest stage, their first trip back to the Finals since 2000, a team notably led by Reggie Miller and coached by Larry Bird. Their journey through the Eastern Conference, including a hard-fought series win, has captured the attention of many.

Across the aisle, the Oklahoma City Thunder represent a burgeoning young powerhouse. Led by MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Thunder surprised many with their rapid ascent, fueled by a talented core of young players and smart asset management. Their dominant performance in the Western Conference Finals solidified their status as legitimate contenders.

The series promises an intriguing clash of styles and star power, featuring dynamic guards like Gilgeous-Alexander and the Pacers' own rising star, Tyrese Haliburton. While betting odds currently favor the Thunder and list SGA as the favorite for Finals MVP, the Pacers have proven their ability to surprise and play spoiler throughout the playoffs.

As Thursday night approaches, anticipation is building for a Finals that defies conventional expectations and showcases two teams that built their way to contention outside of the league's highest spending tiers. It's set to be a fresh and exciting conclusion to the NBA season.
