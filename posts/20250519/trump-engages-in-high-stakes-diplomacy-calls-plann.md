In a significant diplomatic push, former U.S. President Donald Trump has scheduled separate phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The central objective of these discussions is to make progress towards securing a ceasefire in the protracted war in Ukraine.

The planned calls come amidst growing international pressure to halt the fighting. European leaders recently engaged with Trump, specifically urging him to leverage his influence to pressure Putin into agreeing to a potential 30-day ceasefire.

Reports indicate that Trump is frustrated by the continuation of the conflict and is taking direct action to address it. Beyond the calls with the key figures in the conflict, he also plans to engage with various members of NATO, signaling a broader diplomatic effort.

The initiative has sparked discussion, with social media sentiment appearing mostly positive regarding the prospect of a ceasefire, although some debate surrounding the specifics and potential outcomes exists.

These high-level discussions represent a notable effort by Trump to insert himself into the ongoing peace efforts, aiming to achieve a breakthrough where previous initiatives have stalled.
