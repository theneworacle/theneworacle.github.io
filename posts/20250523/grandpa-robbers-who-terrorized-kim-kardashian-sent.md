Years after the high-profile, multi-million dollar armed robbery of reality TV star Kim Kardashian in Paris, a verdict has been reached in the case involving the group dubbed the "grandpa robbers."

A Paris court has found eight people guilty in connection with the 2016 incident, during which masked intruders tied up Kardashian in her rental apartment and stole jewelry worth millions. Among those convicted is the alleged ringleader.

Ten people were initially on trial for charges including armed robbery as part of an organized gang and kidnapping. The court acquitted two of the defendants.

The convicted individuals received various penalties, including prison sentences. However, reports indicate that due to time already served in pre-trial detention and other potential factors in the French legal system, some of those sentenced will ultimately not face additional time behind bars.

Kim Kardashian, who testified during the investigation about the terrifying ordeal, has reportedly expressed satisfaction with the court's ruling.

The verdict has generated discussion, with social media sentiment appearing mostly positive, though some debate exists surrounding the outcome and the fact that some individuals will walk free despite their convictions.
