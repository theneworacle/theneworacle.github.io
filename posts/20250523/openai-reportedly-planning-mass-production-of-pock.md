OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT and DALL-E, is primarily known for its groundbreaking work in artificial intelligence models. However, recent reports suggest the company is setting its sights beyond software, with plans to develop and ship its own physical AI devices.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has hinted at the development of secret, pocket-sized AI devices designed for everyday use. The ambition is significant, with a reported target of shipping a staggering 100 million units.

While details about the device's specific form factor and functionality remain scarce, this move aligns with OpenAI's broader strategic direction. It follows the company's major acquisition of 'io', the design firm founded by former Apple design guru Jony Ive. That $6.5 billion acquisition was explicitly aimed at developing a "new generation of devices" and exploring alternative, potentially post-screen, ways for users to interact with AI.

The concept of an ambient, always-available AI companion in a pocket-sized device raises fascinating possibilities. Such a device could offer seamless access to AI capabilities without needing a smartphone or computer, potentially acting as a personalized assistant, information source, or creative tool throughout the day. This could represent a significant shift in how we integrate AI into our daily lives, moving towards more intuitive and less screen-dependent interactions.

However, ambitious hardware projects of this scale come with immense challenges, including design, manufacturing, distribution, and privacy considerations. The market for personal tech is highly competitive, and convincing users to adopt a new dedicated AI device will require a compelling use case and seamless experience.

OpenAI's potential foray into hardware, coupled with its acquisition of top-tier design talent, signals a clear intention to not just build the intelligence, but also shape the physical interfaces through which we access it. If successful, this could mark a pivotal moment in the evolution of personal technology and the role of AI within it.
