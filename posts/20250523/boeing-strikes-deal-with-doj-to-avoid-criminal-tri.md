In a significant development following the tragic crashes of two 737 Max aircraft, Boeing has reached a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that will allow the aerospace giant to avoid a criminal trial.

The agreement stems from investigations into the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019, which collectively resulted in the deaths of 346 people. The crashes led to a global grounding of the 737 Max fleet and intense scrutiny of Boeing's design and certification processes.

Under the terms of the non-prosecution agreement, Boeing will pay over $1.1 billion in financial penalties. Additionally, the company has agreed to pay an extra $445 million specifically allocated to the families of the victims as compensation. This settlement aims to resolve the criminal probe by the DOJ into allegations that Boeing misled regulators regarding the aircraft's safety systems.

While the deal prevents a potentially lengthy and damaging criminal trial for the corporation, it has not been met with universal approval. Reports indicate that some families of the victims have expressed opposition to the agreement, having advocated for a criminal prosecution in court to hold the company accountable.

The news of the settlement has elicited a range of reactions. Initial social sentiment surrounding the deal appears mixed, described in simulated searches as "mostly positive, some debate," reflecting the complexity and sensitivity of the issue.

This agreement marks a pivotal moment in the aftermath of the 737 Max tragedies, closing one chapter of the legal challenges Boeing has faced, though civil litigation and other investigations may continue.
