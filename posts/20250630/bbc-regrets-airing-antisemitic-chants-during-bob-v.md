The BBC has publicly regretted its decision to livestream a performance by punk-rap duo Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury Festival, during which the band reportedly led the crowd in chants described as antisemitic and directed at Israeli troops. Specifically, reports indicate the chants included “Free, free Palestine” and “Death, death to the IDF (Israel Defence Forces)”.

The controversial moments occurred during Bob Vylan's set on Saturday. While the BBC provided a livestream of the event, the decision was made not to cut away during the chants, a move that drew significant criticism after the fact.

In a subsequent statement, the British broadcaster expressed its regret, calling the sentiments expressed during the chants "utterly unacceptable" and antisemitic. The BBC stated that while their team was handling a live situation, with hindsight, they should have pulled the stream. They also indicated they would review their guidance regarding live event broadcasts.

Beyond the BBC's statement, the incident drew criticism from other prominent figures. Prime Minister Keir Starmer reportedly called the chants "appalling hate speech," and broadcasting regulator Ofcom stated it was "very concerned" and speaking to the BBC about its procedures.

The incident has garnered widespread attention and sparked debate online. While simulated social media sentiment appears largely negative towards the chants themselves, there is also discussion surrounding the broader implications and the BBC's handling of the live broadcast.

Beyond the BBC's apology, the incident could have further consequences for Bob Vylan. News reports suggest the duo may face a potential ban from entering the United States as a result of their actions at the festival.

In response to the controversy, Bob Vylan's Bobby Vylan (Pascal Robinson-Foster) posted a statement online emphasizing the importance of teaching children to "speak up for the change they want and need."
