The fight against climate change requires innovative solutions, and artificial intelligence is emerging as a powerful tool in this global effort. IBM is at the forefront of this movement, recently recognized at the AI Impact Awards 2025 for its significant contributions to helping cities plan for a cleaner and cooler energy future.

IBM's award-winning initiative centers on the development of sophisticated AI-powered digital maps. These detailed maps provide city officials with critical data and insights, enabling them to more effectively forecast urban growth, predict future energy demands, and strategically plan adaptation measures against the rising impacts of climate change. This technology is proving particularly valuable in the developing world, where rapid urbanization and climate vulnerability present unique challenges.

This recognition underscores the importance of leveraging AI for societal benefit. IBM's Chairman, President, and CEO, Arvind Krishna, was individually honored with a TIME100 AI Impact Award for his leadership in driving these sustainability efforts.

Furthermore, IBM is actively collaborating with global partners to amplify its impact. Through the IBM Sustainability Accelerator program, the company has teamed up with the C40 Cities network, a group of nearly 100 mayors from major world cities committed to climate action. This partnership aims to scale up climate innovation and implement AI-driven solutions in urban areas worldwide.

The recognition of IBM, alongside other innovators like Straive (honored for AI visualization tools for urban heat management), signals a broader trend: AI is no longer just a tool for business efficiency but a crucial asset for addressing complex environmental and urban challenges. As cities continue to grow and face increasing climate pressures, AI-powered solutions will play an increasingly vital role in building a sustainable and resilient future.
