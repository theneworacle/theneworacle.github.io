Nvidia's recent performance and commentary continue to underscore the explosive growth of Artificial Intelligence. But as the AI revolution expands, its impact reaches far beyond the chip manufacturers themselves. Recent insights from Nvidia management, including CEO Jensen Huang, have drawn attention to companies positioned to capitalize on AI in diverse fields, from healthcare to industrial manufacturing and data center infrastructure.

Here are three companies, highlighted by Nvidia's commentary, that are poised to thrive in the burgeoning AI era:

### GE HealthCare Technologies: AI in Medical Imaging

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang specifically mentioned his company's collaboration with GE HealthCare Technologies, noting the healthcare giant's use of Nvidia's AI-powered robotics platform, Isaac. GE HealthCare is integrating AI into its leading imaging systems, such as ultrasound, MRI, and X-ray equipment. This allows for enhanced analysis of medical images, better patient guidance during procedures, automated data gathering, and improved support for clinical decision-making and patient monitoring. AI adds significant value across GE HealthCare's businesses, potentially leading to better patient outcomes and driving long-term sales growth.

### PTC: Powering Industrial AI and the 'AI Factory'

Industrial AI is another area gaining traction, and Nvidia management points to industrial software company PTC as a key player. Nvidia's GPUs are instrumental in enabling designers to utilize PTC's computer-aided design (CAD) software. This partnership facilitates the creation of real-time digital models – or digital twins – that interact with the physical world. By integrating advanced, real-time AI analytics into its product lifecycle management (PLM) software, PTC helps improve the performance of machinery and processes. This aligns with Jensen Huang's vision that "Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it," driven by the need for automation and robotics to make reshoring manufacturing cost-effective.

### Vertiv: The Critical Infrastructure for AI Data Centers

The immense computational power required for AI training and inference necessitates robust data center infrastructure. Vertiv plays a crucial role by providing power and cooling solutions for these energy-intensive facilities. As AI workloads grow denser, data centers need more efficient power distribution. Vertiv is developing 800-volt direct current (VDC) power architecture, scheduled for launch in the second half of 2026, aligning with Nvidia's plans for transitioning to higher-efficiency 800V HVDC data centers starting in 2027. Vertiv's specialized solutions, including rectifiers, busways, and converters, are essential for converting and distributing power within data centers, making them a foundational contributor to AI's expansion, despite facing competition from larger players.

These examples illustrate that the AI revolution's benefits extend across a wide range of industries, creating opportunities for companies providing the tools, software, and infrastructure that support AI's deployment and growth. Insights from a market leader like Nvidia serve as valuable indicators of where the AI wave is heading next.
