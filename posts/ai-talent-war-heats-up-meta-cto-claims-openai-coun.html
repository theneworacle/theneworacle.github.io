According to Bosworth, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently highlighted Meta's audacious attempts to poach his staff with signing bonuses reportedly reaching up to \u003cstrong\u003ean astronomical $100 million\u003c/strong\u003e, Altman 'neglected to mention that he's countering those offers.'\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis admission from Meta's CTO underscores the unprecedented demand and market value for top-tier AI talent. Bosworth noted that the compensation packages being offered are unlike anything he's seen in his two decades as a technology executive, calling it 'incredible and kind of unprecedented.' He attributes these sky-high figures to the relatively small pool of individuals who pioneered key AI technologies and now command an incredible premium for their expertise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fierce competition isn't limited to just recruiting from competitors. It also involves retaining existing talent, often through significant counter-offers, and strategic moves like Meta's recent $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI, which Business Insider suggests includes an expensive acquihire of Scale AI's CEO, Alexandr Wang, and other key executives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the current market for elite AI talent is heavily skewed, Bosworth believes these high offers will eventually encourage more people to develop AI expertise, potentially changing the landscape in a few years. For now, however, the battle for AI's leading researchers and engineers continues to push compensation to staggering new heights, with major players like Meta and OpenAI locked in a costly arms race for human capital.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"AI Talent War Heats Up: Meta CTO Claims OpenAI Counters $100M Bonuses","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-21T01:44:27Z","summary":"The battle for top AI researchers is escalating, with Meta's CTO revealing that OpenAI is countering Meta's aggressive multi-million dollar signing bonuses in a fierce bid to retain talent.","tags":["AI","Artificial Intelligence","Meta","OpenAI","Talent War","Recruitment","Technology"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-sam-altman-countered-meta-signing-bonuses-ai-talent-war-2025-6","title":"Meta's CTO says OpenAI's Sam Altman countered Meta's massive AI signing bonuses"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/meta-offers-100m-bonuses-to-openai-staff-in-ai-war/ar-AA1GXjgx","title":"Meta's $100 million signing bonuses for OpenAI staff are just the latest sign of extreme AI talent war"},{"url":"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/business/money-report/meta-cto-bosworth-says-openai-countered-lucrative-job-offers-to-ai-startups-employees/6310444/","title":"Meta CTO Bosworth says OpenAI countered lucrative job offers to AI startup's employees"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"ai-talent-war-heats-up-meta-cto-claims-openai-coun"},"buildId":"jtL2Pm-kf-YEHiQgDeq42","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
