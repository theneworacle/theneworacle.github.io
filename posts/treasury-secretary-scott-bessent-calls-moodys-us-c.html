Such actions by credit rating agencies can influence borrowing costs for the government, although the practical impact on U.S. Treasury yields is often debated due to the dollar's status as a global reserve currency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecretary Bessent's remarks suggest a view that rating agencies' decisions often reflect past or current conditions rather than anticipating future improvements or the effects of current policy directions. He reportedly attributed the underlying fiscal concerns to federal spending during the previous administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis comments also arrive amidst ongoing political discussions around fiscal policy, including debates surrounding potential tax legislation.
