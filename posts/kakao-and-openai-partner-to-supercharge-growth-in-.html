Facing sluggish sales and fierce competition from rivals like Naver, Kakao is betting on AI to transform user experience and boost its core businesses like advertising and commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strategy involves a hybrid approach, leveraging OpenAI's advanced large language models (LLMs) for complex tasks, while utilizing Kakao's own smaller, more cost-efficient, and secure small language models (SLMs) for simpler functions. This allows Kakao to develop sophisticated AI agents capable of performing multi-step actions for users – such as booking a restaurant, adding a calendar event, hailing a taxi, and processing payment – all within the KakaoTalk environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor OpenAI, the partnership provides invaluable access to a highly tech-savvy market with a significant base of paying ChatGPT users outside the United States. This aligns with OpenAI's broader expansion strategy in Asia, including recent ventures in Japan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKakao is backing this AI push with substantial infrastructure investment, including building new data centers. They have already launched a beta testing app called Kanana, featuring AI agents powered by both OpenAI and Kakao's models, with a wider rollout of AI agents in KakaoTalk targeted for November 2025. The company projects this AI integration could drive double-digit sales growth within two years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitial social sentiment around the partnership appears largely positive, reflecting optimism about the potential for AI to enhance user experience in South Korea's most popular digital platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Kakao and OpenAI Partner to Supercharge Growth in South Korea's Digital Landscape","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-03T04:34:30Z","summary":"Korean internet giant Kakao is teaming up with OpenAI to integrate advanced AI capabilities into its dominant KakaoTalk superapp, aiming to deliver hyper-personalized services and drive significant growth in the South Korean market.","tags":["AI","OpenAI","Kakao","South Korea","Partnership","Technology","Superapp","KakaoTalk","Business Growth"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkang/2025/07/02/korean-internet-giant-kakao-teams-with-open-ai-to-jumpstart-growth/","title":"Korean Internet Giant Kakao Teams With Open AI To Jumpstart Growth"},{"url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2025/02/04/koreas-kakao-teams-up-with-openai-to-develop-ai-products/","title":"Korea's Kakao Teams Up With OpenAI To Develop AI Products"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/openai-kakao-team-up-for-ai-products-talks-with-softbank-samsung-on-stargate/ar-AA1ynJHf","title":"OpenAI, Kakao team up for AI products; talks with SoftBank, Samsung on Stargate"},{"url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/openai-doubles-down-on-asia-partners-with-kakao-after-its-big-deal-with-softbank/","title":"OpenAI partners with Korea's Kakao after inking SoftBank Japanese JV"},{"url":"https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/2025020312253/openai-to-jointly-develop-ai-products-with-south-korean-tech-giant-kakao","title":"OpenAI to Jointly Develop AI Products With South Korean Tech Giant Kakao"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"kakao-and-openai-partner-to-supercharge-growth-in-"},"buildId":"46vzEwJZqOZ711cgYDVFF","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
