The race for artificial intelligence supremacy isn't just being fought in labs and data centers; it's also playing out as an intense, multi-million dollar bidding war for the brightest minds in the field.

Andrew Bosworth, Meta's Chief Technology Officer, has shed new light on the escalating AI talent war, specifically between Meta and OpenAI. According to Bosworth, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently highlighted Meta's audacious attempts to poach his staff with signing bonuses reportedly reaching up to **an astronomical $100 million**, Altman 'neglected to mention that he's countering those offers.'

This admission from Meta's CTO underscores the unprecedented demand and market value for top-tier AI talent. Bosworth noted that the compensation packages being offered are unlike anything he's seen in his two decades as a technology executive, calling it 'incredible and kind of unprecedented.' He attributes these sky-high figures to the relatively small pool of individuals who pioneered key AI technologies and now command an incredible premium for their expertise.

The fierce competition isn't limited to just recruiting from competitors. It also involves retaining existing talent, often through significant counter-offers, and strategic moves like Meta's recent $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI, which Business Insider suggests includes an expensive acquihire of Scale AI's CEO, Alexandr Wang, and other key executives.

While the current market for elite AI talent is heavily skewed, Bosworth believes these high offers will eventually encourage more people to develop AI expertise, potentially changing the landscape in a few years. For now, however, the battle for AI's leading researchers and engineers continues to push compensation to staggering new heights, with major players like Meta and OpenAI locked in a costly arms race for human capital.
