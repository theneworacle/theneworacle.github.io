He cited compelling examples, from upscaling the classic \"Wizard of Oz\" for a massive 16K screen in Las Vegas to director Darren Aronofsky using AI for challenging shots and platforms like Toonsutra enabling real-time translation into 1000 languages with accurate lip sync. These instances, he argued, demonstrate how AI can overcome technical and linguistic barriers, making global reach instantaneous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsia, Gupta believes, is uniquely positioned to lead this charge. With 50% of the world's population and 60% of its youth, the region possesses a young, dynamic, and tech-embracing demographic. More importantly, he highlighted Asia's deep and rich cultural tradition of storytelling, from ancient epics to modern K-dramas and Indian web series, which are already captivating global audiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite this creative momentum, Asia currently contributes only 15% to global media revenues. Gupta sees this as a massive untapped economic opportunity. The region's $60 billion media and entertainment business has significant \"headroom to grow and capture,\" a process he believes will be \"turbocharged\" by the strategic integration of AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, concerns exist within the industry, particularly regarding talent management and protecting creativity. Gupta acknowledged these challenges during a fireside chat, drawing parallels to the music industry's initial fears about digital transformation. His message was clear: collaboration across stakeholders is key to ensuring creativity is not only protected but flourishes in the age of AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcluding with a challenge to the assembled storytellers, Gupta posed the question: If anything is possible with this AI \"magic wand,\" what transformative creations and business models will emerge from Asia?\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"AI: The 'Magic Wand' for Asia's Storytelling Future, Says Google's Sanjay Gupta","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-25T04:32:14Z","summary":"Google APAC president Sanjay Gupta recently spoke at the APOS conference, highlighting artificial intelligence as a transformative tool with the potential to position Asia at the forefront of global storytelling, despite acknowledging concerns around talent and creativity.","tags":["AI","Storytelling","Asia","Media","Entertainment","Google","APOS","Technology"],"sources":[{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/google-sanjay-gupta-ai-1236439871/","title":"Google’s Sanjay Gupta Sees AI as ‘Magic Wand’ for Asia’s Storytellers at APOS"},{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/global/news/google-sanjay-gupta-ai-1236439871/","title":"Google’s Sanjay Gupta Sees AI as ‘Magic Wand’ for Asia’s Storytellers at APOS"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/google-s-sanjay-gupta-talks-ai-s-top-two-challenges-and-importance-of-on-the-go-content-in-asia-apos/ar-AA1Hmym8","title":"Google’s Sanjay Gupta Talks AI’s Top Two Challenges And Importance Of ‘On-The-Go’ Content In Asia - APOS"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"ai-the-magic-wand-for-asias-storytelling-future-sa"},"buildId":"NmRdtz8bFs0MdqobTBTHH","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
