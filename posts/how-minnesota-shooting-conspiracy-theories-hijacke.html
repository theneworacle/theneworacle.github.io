In the immediate aftermath, even as information was scarce, narratives began to take hold, often attempting to assign blame to political opponents or shadowy forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, initial theories widely circulated, particularly on the far-right, attempting to link the alleged shooter to left-wing groups or even the state's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, using terms like \"Walz appointee\" to push a false narrative that the violence stemmed from the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as facts about the alleged shooter emerged, including reports of his registration as a Republican, voting for Donald Trump, and ties to an evangelical ministry that preached against abortion and demonized the LGBTQ community, the conspiracy theories didn't disappear. Instead, they shifted, pivoting to \"psyop,\" \"false flag,\" and \"deep state\" narratives designed to distance the shooter from any connection to the MAGA movement and paint the event as a setup or an orchestrated deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProminent figures, including social media influencers and some Republican politicians, played a significant role in amplifying these shifting narratives, further muddying the waters and attempting to reframe an act of alleged right-wing violence. This tactic is not new; conspiracy theories are often used to deflect blame and create convoluted explanations when violent acts are committed by individuals associated with a particular political ideology. This phenomenon of online conspiracy theories is not unique to one political side, with similar trends observed, such as \"BlueAnon\" theories circulating after other politically charged events, illustrating a broader issue of political misinformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hijacking of social media feeds by these narratives highlights the persistent challenge of misinformation in the digital age and the speed at which unsubstantiated claims can spread. This rapid proliferation of baseless theories not only impacts public perception and political discourse but also undermines trust in verifiable information and institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"How Minnesota Shooting Conspiracy Theories Hijacked Social Media Feeds","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-17T12:34:07Z","summary":"In the wake of the tragic Minnesota shooting targeting lawmakers, social media platforms were rapidly flooded with baseless conspiracy theories, illustrating a disturbing trend in online misinformation and its political weaponization.","tags":["Minnesota Shooting","Conspiracy Theories","Social Media","Misinformation","Politics","MAGA","Psyop","False Flag","Deep State","Online Discourse"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/how-minnesota-shooting-conspiracy-theories-hijacked-social-media-feeds/ar-AA1GRNOa","title":"How Minnesota shooting conspiracy theories hijacked social media feeds"},{"url":"https://www.wired.com/story/psyop-far-right-conspiracy-theories-minnesota-shooting/","title":"'Psyop': How Far-Right Conspiracy Theories About the Minnesota Shooting Evolved to Protect MAGA"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/politics/government/maddow-blog-too-many-republicans-embrace-conspiracy-theories-and-misinfo-after-minnesota-shootings/ar-AA1GObpV","title":"Maddow Blog | Too many Republicans embrace conspiracy theories and misinfo after Minnesota shootings"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/maga-whips-up-conspiracy-theories-to-muddy-an-act-of-right-wing-violence/ar-AA1GPZHa","title":"MAGA Whips Up Conspiracy Theories To Muddy An Act Of Right-Wing Violence"},{"url":"https://www.niemanlab.org/reading/blueanon-conspiracy-theories-are-flooding-social-media-after-the-trump-rally-shooting/","title":"\"BlueAnon\" conspiracy theories are flooding social media after the Trump rally shooting"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"how-minnesota-shooting-conspiracy-theories-hijacke"},"buildId":"oJFJwJXJh33ioZpjH4B5z","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
