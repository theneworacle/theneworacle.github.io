The human brain is most adaptable and capable of forming new connections during the first seven years of life. Wang theorizes that children born with access to advanced BCIs during this critical period could integrate and utilize the technology in profoundly different, and potentially far more advanced, ways than adults who adopt it later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis rationale points to the rapidly accelerating pace of technological advancement, particularly in AI and related fields like BCIs, compared to the much slower rate of human biological evolution. Wang believes that for humanity to keep pace with increasingly intelligent artificial systems, a more direct interface between our brains and AI/the internet will become necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis personal decision comes at a time of significant professional change for Wang. Scale AI recently received a substantial investment from Meta, and Wang is transitioning to a new role at Meta to work on \"superintelligence\" initiatives. This new position underscores his deep involvement in pushing the boundaries of AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the concept of integrating technology directly with the human brain raises complex ethical questions regarding privacy, data security, and the very definition of being human, Wang views this convergence as an almost inevitable step. He acknowledges the potential dangers but asserted it's a necessary step humanity must take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies like Neuralink are already making tangible progress, with successful human implants demonstrating the ability to control devices with thought alone. While still in early stages, these advancements lend a degree of plausibility to the future Wang envisions – one where the next generation might grow up seamlessly integrated with artificial intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWang's unconventional stance serves as a compelling, if perhaps unsettling, look into how leaders at the forefront of the AI revolution are contemplating the technology's impact not just on industries, but on the fundamental aspects of human development and future generations. It's a conversation that is only just beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"The Neuralink Generation?
