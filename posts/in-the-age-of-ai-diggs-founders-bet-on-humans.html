The core idea is to lean heavily on human curation and community participation as the primary method for discovering and ranking content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe founders believe that the current landscape, dominated by AI-driven algorithms, presents an opportunity to create a platform where the people who generate content and manage online communities are given a more significant role and stake in the platform's success. This contrasts with models where algorithms dictate visibility, often leading to filter bubbles or prioritizing engagement metrics over quality or human judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitial social sentiment regarding the relaunch and its human-centric focus appears mostly positive, suggesting a potential appetite among users for alternatives to purely algorithmic content feeds. However, some debate also exists, perhaps reflecting questions about the viability of a human-curated model at scale in the current competitive landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy putting human editors, community managers, and active users at the forefront of content discovery, Digg's founders are positioning the relaunched site not just as a callback to its roots, but as a deliberate counterpoint to the pervasive influence of AI and algorithms in how we consume information online.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"In the Age of AI, Digg's Founders Bet on Humans","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-02T20:23:44Z","summary":"Amidst the rise of AI-driven content and algorithms, the original founders of Digg are relaunching the platform with a bold vision: prioritizing human curation and community to build a site specifically for the AI era.","tags":["AI","Digg","Human Curation","Social Media","Content Discovery","Tech Relaunch","Algorithms"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"in-the-age-of-ai-diggs-founders-bet-on-humans"},"buildId":"vMp7j8q7PMUzKVJxQZ4Jm","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
