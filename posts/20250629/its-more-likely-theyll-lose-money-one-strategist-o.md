While the buzz around Artificial Intelligence continues to drive significant investment and positive sentiment in the market, not everyone is convinced that these investments will automatically translate into substantial profits.

Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, has voiced a bearish perspective on the AI trade. He argues that despite the potential for AI to deliver significant productivity gains, the intense competition among major tech companies could prevent these benefits from flowing down to the bottom line.

According to Berezin, it's "more likely they'll lose money" when referring to the big tech players pouring vast resources into AI development and deployment. This view offers a notable counterpoint to the generally positive social sentiment surrounding the AI trade, highlighting the potential challenges and financial risks that exist beneath the surface of the AI boom.
