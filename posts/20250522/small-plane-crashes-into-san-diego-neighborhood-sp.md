Tragedy struck a San Diego neighborhood Thursday morning when a small plane plummeted from the sky, crashing directly into the Murphy Canyon area. The impact caused severe damage to multiple homes and ignited fires that quickly spread, engulfing approximately 15 houses and numerous cars in flames.

The incident occurred during a period of dense fog, severely limiting visibility at the time of the crash. Emergency crews were immediately dispatched to the scene, focusing efforts on searching affected homes and evacuating residents from several blocks due to the hazardous conditions, including the smell of jet fuel.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identified the aircraft as a Cessna 550. It crashed near the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. As of now, the number of individuals aboard the plane and whether there were any injuries or fatalities on the ground or in the aircraft remain unknown.

Authorities are continuing their investigation to determine the cause of the crash. The community is grappling with the sudden and destructive event, with many residents displaced and facing significant loss.
