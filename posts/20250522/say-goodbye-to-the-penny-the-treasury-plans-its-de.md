Get ready for a potential change in your pocket change. The U.S. Treasury Department has announced a significant plan: the phasing out of the humble penny.

According to a recent statement, the Treasury will stop producing new one-cent coins and intends to remove them from circulation starting early next year. This move isn't entirely new; discussions about eliminating the penny have surfaced periodically, including under the Trump administration, and a bipartisan group of lawmakers even introduced a "Common Cents Act" aimed at halting penny production.

The primary driver behind this decision is the cost of producing the penny, which often exceeds its face value, making it a financial loss for the government to mint. For years, critics have labeled the coin as wasteful and outdated in the modern economy.

So, what does this mean for daily transactions? Businesses will likely need to adjust pricing to the nearest nickel, rounding prices up or down. While this might seem like a small change, it could have minor impacts on consumer prices and how cash transactions are handled.

Public sentiment regarding the penny's potential demise appears to be largely positive, reflecting a general perception that the coin is cumbersome and holds little value. However, there is some debate, with proponents citing tradition or the minor inflationary effect rounding could have.

The Treasury's plan marks a concrete step towards removing the penny from circulation, signaling the end of an era for the one-cent coin.
