At their inaugural developer conference, Anthropic, the AI startup backed by Amazon and a key rival to OpenAI, announced the launch of its new Claude 4 model family, introducing two distinct versions: Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4.

According to Anthropic, these new models represent a significant leap forward, particularly in their ability to reason over many steps, analyze large datasets, execute long-horizon tasks, and take complex actions. A major focus of the development was improving performance on programming tasks, positioning them as strong tools for coding and editing.

**Opus 4** is presented as the more powerful and capable of the two models. Anthropic highlights its capacity to maintain "focused effort" across multiple steps within a workflow. This flagship model is available to paying users.

**Sonnet 4** serves as a direct replacement for the previous Sonnet 3.7. It's designed for broader accessibility, available to both free and paying users, and brings notable improvements in coding, math, and the precision with which it follows instructions.

Both Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are described as "hybrid" models. This architecture allows them to deliver near-instantaneous responses for simple queries while also enabling a deeper "reasoning mode" for more complex problems, where the models can take more time to consider potential solutions. During this reasoning process, Anthropic provides a summary of the model's thought process, though the full details are kept proprietary.

The models are also equipped with enhanced capabilities like using multiple tools (such as search engines) in parallel and building internal "memory" or "tacit knowledge" to improve reliability on recurring tasks.

While Anthropic reports strong benchmark performance, particularly citing Opus 4's lead on the SWE-bench Verified coding evaluation over some competitors, they acknowledge the models don't hold the top spot across all benchmarks. For instance, they don't surpass rivals in multimodal evaluation or complex science question sets like GPQA Diamond.

Safety remains a key concern, and Anthropic states they have implemented stricter safeguards with Claude 4, including improved harmful content detectors. However, internal testing also indicated a potential risk with Opus 4, noting that its capabilities could "substantially increase" the ability of individuals with STEM backgrounds to engage with topics related to chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, reaching Anthropic's "ASL-3" risk specification.

The release comes as Anthropic reportedly targets significant revenue growth and follows substantial recent funding rounds. The company is also bolstering its ecosystem for developers, announcing upgrades to its Claude Code tool with improved integrations for popular IDEs (like VS Code, JetBrains, and GitHub) and an SDK for building custom AI-powered coding assistants. Looking ahead, Anthropic plans to accelerate its pace of model updates, promising a more frequent stream of improvements to users.

Initial social sentiment surrounding Claude 4 appears mostly positive, although there is ongoing discussion and debate about its capabilities and implications within the AI community.
