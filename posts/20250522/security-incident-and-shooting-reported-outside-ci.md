A security incident unfolded early Thursday morning outside the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) headquarters in McLean, Virginia, leading to a shooting. 

According to initial reports, the incident involved security guards on the CIA property. During the confrontation, guards shot a person. Authorities responding to the scene have stated that the shooting was nonfatal.

The Fairfax County Police Department assisted CIA police with traffic control in the area following the incident. The precise details of what led to the security incident and shooting are not immediately clear, and the CIA is reportedly conducting an investigation.

Incidents at secure federal facilities like the CIA headquarters are rare and typically involve heightened security responses. The situation briefly led to temporary closures or restrictions around the Langley compound as authorities secured the area and began their investigation.

Further details are expected as the investigation progresses.
