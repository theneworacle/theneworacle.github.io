In a move that underscores the growing integration of artificial intelligence into corporate communications, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski recently used an AI doppelganger to deliver the company's latest earnings report highlights.

The AI-generated version of Siemiatkowski presented key financial information, a step that appears consistent with Klarna's overall strategy to heavily leverage AI across its operations. Reports indicate that the digital doppelganger was surprisingly realistic, with only subtle cues revealing its artificial nature.

This high-profile use of an AI avatar comes amidst a period of active AI experimentation for Klarna. The company recently made headlines when it announced it was reversing a decision to replace a significant portion of its human customer service workforce with AI agents, following reports of increased losses. This contrast highlights the complexities companies face in finding the right balance between AI efficiency and effective business operations.

The use of the AI doppelganger for earnings delivery has garnered attention, with simulated social sentiment suggesting a mostly positive reaction, albeit with some debate surrounding the technology.

Klarna's deployment of a digital CEO for a public announcement like an earnings report marks another notable example of businesses exploring innovative, and sometimes unconventional, applications for AI beyond traditional tasks.
