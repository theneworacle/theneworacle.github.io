According to a Bloomberg report, confirmed by multiple news outlets, the Department of Justice is investigating an agreement between Google and the popular AI chatbot startup, Character.AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core of the probe appears to center on the nature of the deal itself. While not a traditional acquisition involving an exchange of shares, the agreement reportedly included Character.AI's co-founders returning to Google and provision for investor payouts. Regulators are reportedly examining whether this structure was intentionally designed to avoid triggering the standard regulatory review process that accompanies mergers and acquisitions, and if Google's ability to use Character.AI's technology through this agreement violates antitrust law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharacter.AI, known for its technology enabling users to create and interact with customizable AI characters, represents a significant player in the burgeoning conversational AI space. Google's interest in leveraging such technology is clear, but the method of collaboration has now drawn scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Google spokesperson, Peter Schottenfels, has addressed the report, stating that Google is \"always happy to answer any questions from regulators.\" He also reiterated Google's position that Character.AI remains a separate entity and that Google does not hold an ownership stake in the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe investigation highlights the increasing focus of regulators on the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence market and the deals being struck between major tech players and promising startups. As AI technology becomes more central to search, communication, and various industries, authorities are keen to ensure fair competition and prevent dominant players from stifling innovation or consolidating too much power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the investigation is reportedly in its early stages, it signals a cautious approach from the DOJ regarding how large tech companies engage with and integrate emerging AI technologies. Social sentiment surrounding the news appears mixed, with a general lean towards positivity but ongoing debate about the implications.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Google Under DOJ Antitrust Probe Over Character.AI Deal","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-22T22:19:07Z","summary":"The U.S. Justice Department is reportedly investigating Google's agreement with AI startup Character.AI, examining whether the deal was structured to sidestep regulatory scrutiny and if it violates antitrust law.","tags":["Google","Antitrust","DOJ","Character.AI","AI","Regulation","Technology"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"google-under-doj-antitrust-probe-over-characterai-"},"buildId":"rt3ai4xV3UH1172UjK7pD","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
