Trump specifically linked the incident to his decision to implement this broader ban, which targets travelers from 12 countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to reports, Trump discussed the potential ban with Jewish leaders, and an Egyptian national was reportedly arrested in connection with the Boulder attack he cited as justification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the move has drawn swift objections from some within the Jewish community.
