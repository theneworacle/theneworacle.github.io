They allege that the AI Overviews misuse publisher content without consent, leading to significant declines in website traffic, readership, and ultimately, revenue. According to data cited in reports, some analyses show a dramatic increase in \"zero-click\" searches related to news, meaning users get the information they need directly from the AI summary without visiting the original source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe complaint highlights a critical concern: publishers cannot opt out of having their content used for Google's AI models or summarized in AI Overviews without risking their visibility in standard Google search results. This lack of control, they argue, constitutes unfair practice and threatens the viability of independent journalism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe publishers are seeking an interim measure from the European Commission to immediately prevent what they describe as irreparable harm while the complaint is investigated. This move underscores the urgency they feel regarding the impact of AI Overviews on their operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle has responded to the complaint, defending its AI Overviews feature. A spokesperson stated that these new AI experiences in Search are designed to help people ask more questions, which in turn creates new opportunities for content and businesses to be discovered. They also argued that traffic fluctuations are normal and can be influenced by various factors beyond AI Overviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis complaint in Europe echoes similar legal challenges Google faces elsewhere, including in the United States, regarding its search practices and the impact of AI on publishers. It underscores the growing tension between AI developers leveraging vast amounts of web data for training and content creators seeking fair compensation and control over their work. The outcome of this EU antitrust complaint could have significant implications for how AI is integrated into search and the future economic model for online publishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"European Publishers Accuse Google of Antitrust Violation Over AI Summaries","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-06T12:41:21Z","summary":"Independent publishers in Europe have filed an antitrust complaint against Google, alleging that the tech giant's AI Overviews are harming their businesses by misusing content and diverting traffic.","tags":["AI","Google","Antitrust","EU","Publishing","News","AI Overviews","AI Summaries","Regulation","Copyright"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/google-hit-with-eu-antitrust-lawsuit-over-ai-summaries/ar-AA1I3NSg","title":"Google Hit With EU Antitrust Lawsuit Over AI Summaries"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/google-faces-eu-antitrust-complaint-over-ai-overviews/ar-AA1HYU0N","title":"Google faces EU antitrust complaint over AI Overviews"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/exclusive-googles-ai-overviews-hit-by-eu-antitrust-complaint-from-independent-publishers/ar-AA1HY0UI","title":"Exclusive: Google's AI Overviews hit by EU antitrust complaint from independent publishers"},{"url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/04/business/european-publishers-file-complaint-over-googles-ai-overviews-report/","title":"Google hit with antitrust complaint in EU over AI summaries harming web traffic to news sites: report"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/eu-targets-google-ai-overviews-publishers-file-antitrust-complaint/ar-AA1HYvaS","title":"EU Targets Google AI Overviews: Publishers File Antitrust Complaint"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"european-publishers-accuse-google-of-antitrust-vio"},"buildId":"RLfBmpOGgnOwDk1DkoqZO","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
