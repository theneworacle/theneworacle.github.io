This aggressive strategy aims to rapidly elevate the company's generative AI capabilities and directly compete with established players like OpenAI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spree includes what's been called potentially the 'world’s most expensive acquihire': a reported $14.3 billion deal for a 49% stake in data-labeling firm Scale AI, primarily to bring its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, into Meta's fold. Sources suggest Zuckerberg plans to spend over $1 billion more to attract other leading AI minds to work under Wang, including Daniel Gross (CEO of Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence startup) and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis talent acquisition drive is part of a broader reset of Meta's generative AI ambitions. Reports indicate that Meta has even attempted to poach employees from OpenAI with offers reportedly reaching as high as $100 million, though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims none of their top researchers have accepted. The move underscores a high-stakes battle among tech giants for the limited pool of elite AI researchers, seen as crucial for gaining an edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Meta invests heavily, simulated social sentiment around this news appears mostly positive, though accompanied by some debate.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Meta's Megabucks AI Hiring Spree: Zuckerberg Ramps Up Talent War","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-20T01:46:19Z","summary":"Mark Zuckerberg is making massive investments in top AI talent through lucrative deals and aggressive recruitment, signaling a major push to accelerate Meta's generative AI efforts and directly challenge competitors like OpenAI.","tags":["AI","Meta","Mark Zuckerberg","Hiring","Talent War","Generative AI","Scale AI","OpenAI"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.economist.com/business/2025/06/19/mark-zuckerberg-is-spending-megabucks-on-an-ai-hiring-spree","title":"Mark Zuckerberg is spending megabucks on an AI hiring spree"},{"url":"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/business/money-report/meta-tried-to-buy-ilya-sutskevers-32-billion-ai-startup-but-is-now-planning-to-hire-its-ceo/6309347/","title":"Meta tried to buy Ilya Sutskever’s $32 billion AI startup, but is now planning to hire its CEO"},{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/687173/inside-mark-zuckerbergs-ai-hiring-spree","title":"Inside Mark Zuckerberg’s AI hiring spree"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/sam-altman-says-meta-tried-and-failed-to-poach-openai-s-talent-with-100m-offers/ar-AA1GUFwH","title":"MSN"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/sam-altman-says-meta-offered-openai-staff-100-million-bonuses-as-mark-zuckerberg-ramps-ai-poaching-efforts/ar-AA1GVr7y","title":"MSN"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"metas-megabucks-ai-hiring-spree-zuckerberg-ramps-u"},"buildId":"ugJV1W1WhHYXOyWyvHjx4","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
