The primary concern behind this action is to prevent China from circumventing existing U.S. bans on high-end AI processors, such as those made by Nvidia, by acquiring them through intermediaries in these Southeast Asian nations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to reports, this draft rule represents a broadening of U.S. efforts to curb China's access to critical AI technology. While the U.S. has already imposed direct restrictions on China, the new measures target potential re-export or smuggling routes through other countries involved in the global semiconductor supply chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoutheast Asia, particularly Malaysia, has become a significant hub for semiconductor manufacturing and data center investment. The proposed rule reportedly includes temporary exemptions for U.S. and allied firms to minimize disruption to legitimate supply chain operations like chip packaging, which rely heavily on facilities in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis development is part of the Trump administration's ongoing strategy to maintain a technological advantage by limiting China's access to cutting-edge AI hardware.
