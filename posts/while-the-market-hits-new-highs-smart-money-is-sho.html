Instead of chasing the momentum of high-flying stocks, a significant number of investors are turning into bargain hunters, sifting through the market's discount rack for hidden gems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach, known as value investing, is built on a simple premise: find fundamentally strong companies that the market has temporarily overlooked or undervalued. While some sectors are seeing inflated prices, others are home to solid businesses whose stock prices haven't kept pace, offering a potential opportunity for significant long-term growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy Go Bargain Hunting Now?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current environment presents a unique paradox. The S\u0026#x26;P 500 and Nasdaq are celebrating new peaks, largely fueled by a handful of mega-cap tech stocks. This concentration of growth has left other viable sectors in the dust.
