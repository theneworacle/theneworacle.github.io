Two weeks later, their 12-year-old son, Jaysen Carr, passed away from a rare and deadly infection caused by \u003cem\u003eNaegleria fowleri\u003c/em\u003e, a brain-eating amoeba.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, his grieving parents are speaking out, determined to prevent other families from experiencing their profound loss. They are publicly calling on state agencies and lawmakers to implement more visible and explicit warnings about the potential dangers lurking in warm, freshwater bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Naegleria fowleri?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNaegleria fowleri\u003c/em\u003e is a single-celled living organism that thrives in warm, fresh water like lakes, rivers, and hot springs. It can also be found in soil. While millions of people are exposed to the amoeba each year, infections are incredibly rare. The danger arises when contaminated water is forced up the nose, which can happen during activities like swimming, diving, or water skiing. From the nose, the amoeba travels to the brain, where it causes a devastating infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which destroys brain tissue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Family's Plea for Prevention\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Jaysen's parents, the tragedy is compounded by the belief that it could have been prevented. They argue that simple, clear signage at public access points to lakes could save lives. \"We want to see signs, we want to see warnings,\" Jaysen's father said in a public statement, advocating for information that could empower parents and swimmers to take precautions, such as holding their nose or using nose clips when in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealth officials confirm that while the risk of infection is very low, it is almost always fatal. The tragic death of Jaysen Carr serves as a heartbreaking reminder of the hidden dangers that can accompany summer water activities. As his family bravely shares their story, their call for increased awareness and preventative measures is resonating with a sympathetic public, sparking a crucial conversation about public health and safety at our nation's lakes and rivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Family's Heartbreak: Parents Call for Urgent Warnings After Son Dies from Brain-Eating Amoeba","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-30T08:29:09Z","summary":"Following the tragic death of their 12-year-old son, Jaysen Carr, from a rare brain-eating amoeba after swimming in a South Carolina lake, his parents are channeling their grief into a powerful call for action, urging for better public awareness and clearer warnings to prevent similar tragedies.","tags":["health","public safety","Naegleria fowleri","South Carolina","water safety","tragedy"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/parents-want-more-warnings-after-a-brain-eating-amoeba-killed-their-boy-on-a-south-carolina-lake/ar-AA1JwAqW","title":"Parents want more warnings after a brain-eating amoeba killed their boy on a South Carolina lake"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/what-to-know-about-the-brain-eating-amoeba-that-killed-a-boy-swimming-in-a-lake/ar-AA1JwMpt","title":"What to know about the brain-eating amoeba that killed a boy swimming in a lake"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/parents-of-south-carolina-child-who-died-from-brain-eating-amoeba-call-for-action-awareness/ar-AA1Jxb93","title":"Parents of South Carolina child who died from brain-eating amoeba call for action, awareness"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"familys-heartbreak-parents-call-for-urgent-warning"},"buildId":"miKCLEomu2gz8mN9HNqcg","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
