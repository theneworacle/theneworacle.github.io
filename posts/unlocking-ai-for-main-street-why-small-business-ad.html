Yet, amidst this technological revolution, one crucial segment is notably lagging: small businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent reports confirm that AI adoption among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) remains low, with some surveys indicating usage rates as low as 24-28%.

Many small business owners perceive AI solutions as expensive, requiring substantial upfront investment and ongoing costs that may not fit within their tighter budgets.
