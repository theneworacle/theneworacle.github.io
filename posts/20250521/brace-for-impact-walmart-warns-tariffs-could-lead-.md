Get ready, shoppers. If you frequent the aisles of Walmart, you might soon see higher price tags on some of your favorite goods.

The retail giant has signaled that it expects to raise prices on certain items, potentially starting as early as late May or June. The reason? The company points to the increasing cost pressures from tariffs.

Walmart isn't alone in this prediction. Several other U.S. retailers have also issued warnings about the potential for price increases as a result of tariffs imposed on imported goods.

The potential price hikes have also entered the political arena. President Trump, responding to Walmart's announcement, publicly stated that the company should "eat the tariffs" themselves rather than pass the costs along to consumers and blame tariffs. This highlights the tension between the administration's tariff policy and the financial realities faced by major retailers operating on often-thin margins.

While specific product categories most likely to see increases haven't been detailed, the general warning suggests consumers may need to adjust their budgets for certain items in the coming weeks. The situation underscores the broader economic impact of tariffs, showing how they can trickle down from international trade disputes to affect everyday purchases at the checkout counter.
