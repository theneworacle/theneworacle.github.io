Northern Virginia and the U.S. Congress are mourning the loss of Representative Gerry Connolly, who passed away at the age of 75.

Connolly's death was announced by his family through a statement from his congressional office. A dedicated public servant, he had recently shared the difficult news that his esophageal cancer had returned, leading him to announce his plans to retire at the end of his current term.

A Democrat representing Virginia's 11th Congressional District for over a decade, Connolly was widely known for his unwavering commitment to the federal workforce. Throughout his tenure, he was a vocal proponent of federal employees, championing their rights and defending them against efforts to diminish their protections and benefits.

His advocacy played a significant role in shaping policies affecting civil servants and federal unions, particularly during challenging political climates. As a top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, his work often focused on government operations and the welfare of the federal employees who keep them running.

Rep. Connolly's passing leaves a void in the representation of Northern Virginia and in the halls of Congress, where he was a respected voice for public service and the people who dedicate their careers to it.

Social sentiment following the news has been largely positive, reflecting the respect and appreciation many held for his long career and dedication.
