In a significant development, the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The probe centers on allegations that Cuomo provided false testimony to Congress last year concerning his administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically regarding nursing home data.

The investigation follows a referral from congressional Republicans, who accused Cuomo of potentially concealing the true number of deaths in New York's nursing homes during the pandemic. The focus is on whether Cuomo's administration deliberately misrepresented data presented to Congress.

This criminal inquiry marks a serious escalation in the scrutiny of Cuomo's time in office, adding to previous controversies that led to his resignation. While the details of the investigation are still emerging, a criminal probe implies potential legal ramifications if the allegations are substantiated.

The news has generated considerable discussion, with social media sentiment appearing mostly positive towards the investigation, though some debate on the matter is also present.
