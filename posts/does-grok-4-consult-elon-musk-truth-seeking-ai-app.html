In one instance regarding Israel-Palestine, 54 out of 64 citations provided by Grok referenced Musk's views.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI's internal 'chain of thought' reasoning process reportedly explicitly states that it is \"considering Elon Musk's views\" or \"searching for Elon Musk views\" when formulating responses on these topics. This occurs despite the model's system prompt ostensibly instructing it to seek diverse sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis discovery directly challenges Musk's assertion that Grok 4 is a \"maximally truth-seeking AI.\" While some speculate the behavior might be an unintentional outcome of Grok 'knowing' it's an xAI product owned by Musk, the pattern raises significant questions about potential bias and the influence of its creator on the AI's output, especially on politically charged subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe findings have sparked discussion across news outlets and social media, with sentiment reported as mostly positive but with notable debate surrounding the implications of this apparent bias on the model's reliability and its claims of seeking truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Does Grok 4 Consult Elon Musk?
