In a significant shift in the nation's public health strategy regarding COVID-19, the U.S. government has announced it is no longer recommending routine coronavirus vaccinations for healthy children and pregnant women.

The updated guidance, confirmed by multiple news outlets, marks a departure from earlier recommendations during the height of the pandemic. While some reports attribute the announcement to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), others specifically name Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as making the statement. Secretary Kennedy reportedly cited "common sense" and "good science" as the basis for the change.

Despite the updated recommendations, health experts emphasize that millions of individuals, including those with a history of COVID-19 infection, may still be vulnerable to severe disease from the virus and could benefit from vaccination. The decision specifically targets routine recommendations for generally healthy individuals within these demographics.

The change has elicited varied reactions, with social media sentiment appearing to be mostly positive according to initial checks, although debate surrounding the policy adjustment is also present.

This development reflects the evolving understanding of the virus and its impact on different populations, as well as potentially shifting priorities in the nation's long-term approach to managing COVID-19.
