For decades, the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, or Humvee, has been an icon of the U.S. militaryâ€”a rugged, go-anywhere truck recognized globally. But the era of the 'one-size-fits-all' vehicle is coming to a close as the Army pivots to a more specialized and modern approach.

The iconic Humvee is being replaced by a two-vehicle system designed to offer greater flexibility and protection for soldiers on the modern battlefield.

First is the **Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV)**. Essentially a stripped-down, all-terrain vehicle, the ISV is built for speed and rapid deployment. It's designed to carry a nine-soldier infantry squad and their gear, getting them to their destination quickly without the heavy armor that can slow a vehicle down.

On the other end of the spectrum is the **Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV)**. Developed by Oshkosh Defense, the JLTV is a next-generation armored transport designed with troop survivability as its top priority. It offers a significant upgrade in protection against IEDs and other threats encountered in high-risk environments, a critical lesson learned from conflicts where the Humvee proved vulnerable.

This strategic shift acknowledges that no single vehicle can do everything perfectly. Instead of a jack-of-all-trades, the military is opting for specialists: the unarmored, nimble ISV for when speed is essential, and the heavily armored JLTV for when protection is paramount. This dual approach marks a significant evolution in military ground transport, aiming to provide the right tool for every mission.
