The move, which could be formalized as early as this week, represents a significant federal intervention into the practice known as \"debanking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Driving Force: Politics and Crypto\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe order stems from accusations, voiced by President Donald Trump himself, that major financial players like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase discriminate against him and his supporters. The proposed executive order would direct federal regulators to investigate whether banks that engage in such practices are violating existing laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and consumer protection statutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond partisan politics, the order also specifically addresses the challenges faced by cryptocurrency companies. The crypto industry has long complained of being unfairly targeted and denied basic banking services, a practice they allege was encouraged by regulators under the previous administration. This new directive signals a sharp reversal of that approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA Broader Policy Shift\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis executive order is consistent with a series of pro-cryptocurrency actions from the Trump administration. It follows the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) new \"Project Crypto\" initiative and the recent repeal of a crypto-focused accounting directive. That directive, which was seen as a barrier to banks entering the crypto space, had been vetoed by President Biden before being overturned by Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forthcoming executive order aims to ensure that individuals and businesses can participate in the financial system without fear of being blacklisted for their political affiliations or their involvement in legitimate, albeit controversial, industries. The news has been met with largely positive sentiment from conservative and pro-crypto circles, who see it as a necessary defense of economic freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"White House Targets 'Debanking' with Order to Protect Conservatives, Crypto Firms","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-08-06T01:24:40Z","summary":"The White House is preparing a new executive order aimed at penalizing financial institutions that discriminate against customers based on political views or their involvement in the crypto industry.
