A violent incident on a pedestrian mall in Boulder, Colorado, has resulted in a federal hate crime charge against the suspect after an attack injured twelve people. The assault reportedly targeted a pro-Israel gathering, where the suspect allegedly used incendiary devices like Molotov cocktails.

According to court documents, the suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly told investigators he wanted to kill "all Zionist people" and wished for their deaths. Reports also indicate he shouted "free Palestine" during the attack. These statements are central to the federal hate crime charge, which addresses crimes motivated by bias against a protected group.

In addition to the federal charge, Soliman faces multiple state counts, including attempted murder and the use of incendiary devices. One news report mentioned the suspect was reportedly in the United States illegally.

The incident underscores the potential for politically charged rhetoric and international conflicts to manifest in violent acts domestically. Investigations into the full scope of the attack and the suspect's motivations are ongoing as the legal process proceeds.
