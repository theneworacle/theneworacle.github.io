South Korea is poised for a change in leadership as opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is projected to win the nation's snap presidential election. The projected victory follows a period of significant political turmoil, sparked by the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol late last year over a controversial martial law declaration.

The election, held earlier than scheduled due to the political upheaval, saw citizens casting their votes to navigate the country out of its recent instability. Lee Jae-myung, a veteran center-left leader, secured the necessary support to emerge as the likely winner, according to exit polls and initial projections.

Lee's journey to the brink of the presidency is notable, with reports highlighting his background as a former factory worker. This rise from humble beginnings resonates with a segment of the electorate and underscores the diverse paths to power in South Korean politics.

His projected win is widely seen as a turning point, potentially closing a tumultuous chapter that has gripped the U.S. ally for months. The focus now shifts to how Lee Jae-myung will lead the country, address pressing domestic issues, and navigate international relations in the wake of the recent political instability.

While social sentiment surrounding the election results appears largely positive, some debate remains, reflecting the complex political landscape Lee will inherit.
