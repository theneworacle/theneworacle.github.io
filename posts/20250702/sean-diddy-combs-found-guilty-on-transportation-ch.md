A jury has reached a verdict in the federal trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs. Combs was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.

Crucially, the jury acquitted him of the more severe charges he faced, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.

The conviction on the transportation charges is related to the testimony provided by his ex-partners, Casandra "Cassie" Ventura and "Jane," both of whom testified during the trial.

The trial garnered significant attention, and social media reaction to the verdict is reportedly mixed, leaning towards mostly positive sentiment with some ongoing debate.
