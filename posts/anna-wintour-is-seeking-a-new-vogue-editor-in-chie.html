Now, a significant organizational shift is underway at the legendary fashion magazine, but contrary to some initial reports, the change is more nuanced than a complete stepping down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSources indicate that Anna Wintour is appointing a new head of editorial content specifically to oversee the daily operations of the U.S. edition of Vogue.
