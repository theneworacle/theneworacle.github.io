According to Business Insider, Anthropic's Chief Product Officer, Mike Krieger, confirmed the shift, stating the company is evolving its hiring process to better evaluate candidates in the age of AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We're having to evolve, even as the company at the forefront of a lot of this technology, around how we evaluate candidates,\" Krieger said in an interview. The core reason for the change is the acknowledgment that AI has become an integral part of many roles, especially in areas like software engineering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuture interview processes will incorporate the ability to \"co-use AI.\" Anthropic intends to assess how candidates effectively utilize these tools to solve problems. This includes understanding how they prompt the AI, what they aim to achieve with it, their awareness of its limitations, and how they modify the AI's output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe previous policy, which some news outlets highlighted as counterintuitive for a company promoting AI adoption, will be phased out.
