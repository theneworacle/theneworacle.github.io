Supporters of the bill, such as Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have been vocal about its intended impact, framing it as a necessary step to significantly increase the scale and speed of deportations. One ICE official reportedly described the envisioned operation as akin to an e-commerce giant's logistics, stating, 'Like Prime, but with human beings.'\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the funding and planned expansion have drawn sharp criticism from immigrant advocates and civil liberties groups. Concerns are being raised that this level of funding could lead to the creation of an immigration detention system potentially larger than the U.S. federal prison system. Critics also warn of increased militarization of communities as more agents are deployed and local law enforcement becomes more involved in federal immigration matters. Reports have highlighted controversial tactics, including agents apprehending individuals off the streets and from courthouses, sometimes using unmarked vehicles and inconsistent uniforms, leading some to liken these actions to kidnappings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the increased focus on detention capacity comes amidst ongoing concerns regarding conditions within existing facilities and reports of deaths in ICE custody.
