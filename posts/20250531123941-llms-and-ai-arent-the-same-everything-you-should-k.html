Everything You Should Know About What's Behind Chatbots\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you've used ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or any of the other viral AI chatbots, you've interacted with a Large Language Model (LLM). These systems have captivated the world with their ability to generate human-like text, answer questions, and even write code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, while often used interchangeably in casual conversation, it's crucial to understand that \u003cstrong\u003eLLMs and AI are not the same thing.\u003c/strong\u003e LLMs are a specific \u003cem\u003etype\u003c/em\u003e of Artificial Intelligence, much like a smartphone is a type of computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is AI?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtificial Intelligence is a broad field of computer science dedicated to creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes learning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. AI encompasses a vast array of technologies and approaches, from expert systems and machine learning to computer vision and robotics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere Do LLMs Fit In?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge Language Models are a cutting-edge application within the AI landscape, specifically in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. At their core, LLMs are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink of them as sophisticated predictors of language. Trained on absolutely colossal datasets of text and code (trillions of \"tokens\" or pieces of text), LLMs learn the statistical relationships between words and phrases. They identify patterns, nuances, and context across vast libraries of information – far more than any human could ever process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese models are built using complex neural networks with billions or even trillions of \"parameters,\" which are essentially variables that allow the model to make incredibly nuanced predictions about what language should look like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs explained by experts like Mark Riedl from Georgia Tech, the fundamental task of a language model is to predict the next word given previous words. This predictive power, scaled to an unprecedented degree through \"deep learning\" and massive data, is what enables LLMs to generate coherent paragraphs, articles, or even creative content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey learn through processes akin to showing a child many examples, constantly adjusting their internal \"map of word relationships\" based on accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Power and The Pitfalls of LLMs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLLMs are incredibly powerful at generating fluid, contextually relevant text. They can summarize information, translate languages, answer questions based on their training data, and even write in different styles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, their capabilities come with significant limitations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLack of True Understanding:\u003c/strong\u003e LLMs don't \u003cem\u003eunderstand\u003c/em\u003e meaning the way humans do. They operate based purely on statistical relationships and patterns they've learned from data.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHallucinations:\u003c/strong\u003e Because they are predictive models, not knowledge bases, LLMs can confidently generate entirely false information that sounds plausible. This tendency is known as \"hallucination\" and is a major challenge for reliability.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStruggle with Novelty and Reasoning:\u003c/strong\u003e They are pattern-matching machines. Tasks requiring genuine reasoning, planning, or handling problems fundamentally different from their training data (like a math problem with a unique structure) can be difficult or impossible for them to perform correctly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eData Dependency:\u003c/strong\u003e Their responses are limited by and biased towards the data they were trained on. Controversies exist around the use of copyrighted material in training data.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot Predictive of the Future:\u003c/strong\u003e While they predict the next word, they are not capable of predicting real-world events or performing complex planning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite these limitations, LLMs are rapidly evolving. Researchers are developing different types, including smaller, more efficient models, reasoning models that expose their thought process, and multimodal models trained on images and audio as well as text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy the Distinction Matters\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding that LLMs are a specific \u003cem\u003etype\u003c/em\u003e of AI, primarily focused on language generation and prediction, helps set realistic expectations for what they can and cannot do. It highlights the need for careful evaluation of their outputs and recognition that they are tools that augment, rather than replicate, human intelligence and reasoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs AI continues to integrate into more aspects of our lives, recognizing the specific technologies powering different applications – like LLMs behind chatbots – is essential for navigating this rapidly changing landscape responsibly and effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post was written with assistance from an AI.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"LLMs and AI Aren't the Same.
