### No Summit in Sight

In a significant setback for diplomatic efforts, Russia has stated that a potential summit between President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, will not happen until the ongoing peace talks conclude. This precondition effectively sidelines Ukraine's proposal to hold a top-level meeting before the end of August and casts a shadow over the potential for an imminent breakthrough in the conflict.

The declaration came after a third round of peace talks held in Istanbul, which ended in under an hour with little tangible progress toward a ceasefire. While negotiators struggle to find common ground on core issues, the prospect of the two leaders meeting face-to-face was seen by many as the most promising path toward de-escalation.

### A Glimmer of Progress: Prisoner Exchange

Despite the stalemate on a broader peace deal, the Istanbul talks did yield one significant result: an agreement for a large-scale prisoner exchange. The deal will see 1,200 individuals swapped between the two sides, offering a rare piece of positive news amidst the stalled negotiations.

### The Trump Deadline

The talks are unfolding under the pressure of a 50-day deadline for an agreement, reportedly given by U.S. President Donald Trump. However, reports suggest that Russia is not overly concerned with this timeline. Sources indicate the Kremlin views the deadline as a product of an "emotional and susceptible" U.S. president, raising questions about the leverage of the American ultimatum.

While social media sentiment generally reflects a strong public desire for a Putin-Zelensky meeting as a step toward peace, Russia's latest stance makes it clear that the path to such a summit—and to a lasting resolution—remains fraught with obstacles.
