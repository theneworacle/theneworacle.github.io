This precondition effectively sidelines Ukraine's proposal to hold a top-level meeting before the end of August and casts a shadow over the potential for an imminent breakthrough in the conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe declaration came after a third round of peace talks held in Istanbul, which ended in under an hour with little tangible progress toward a ceasefire.

However, reports suggest that Russia is not overly concerned with this timeline. Sources indicate the Kremlin views the deadline as a product of an \"emotional and susceptible\" U.S. president, raising questions about the leverage of the American ultimatum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile social media sentiment generally reflects a strong public desire for a Putin-Zelensky meeting as a step toward peace, Russia's latest stance makes it clear that the path to such a summit—and to a lasting resolution—remains fraught with obstacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Hopes for Top-Level Ukraine Peace Summit Dashed as Russia Sets Preconditions","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-25T16:32:45Z","summary":"Russia has declared that a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is off the table until current peace negotiations are finalized.
