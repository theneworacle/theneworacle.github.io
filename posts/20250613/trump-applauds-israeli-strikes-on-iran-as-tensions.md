Amidst escalating tensions in the Middle East, Israel has carried out preemptive strikes against Iran. Reports indicate these strikes targeted Iranian nuclear and military sites, resulting in the deaths of Iranian military commanders.

Following the news of the Israeli action, former President Donald Trump reacted positively, publicly stating his approval. According to reports, Trump called the attack "excellent" and suggested that there would be "more to come."

The strikes have heightened fears of further conflict, with an Iranian response in the form of a missile and drone attack reportedly anticipated.

The situation is part of a broader pattern of escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran, involving reciprocal actions and proxy engagements in the region.

Public sentiment surrounding these developments, including Trump's reaction, appears to be mostly positive, though accompanied by some debate on social media platforms.
