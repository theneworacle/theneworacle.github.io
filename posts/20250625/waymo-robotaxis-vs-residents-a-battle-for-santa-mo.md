    title: "Residents say Waymo robotaxis are driving them mad. Can AI and humans coexist?"
---

In the quiet city of Santa Monica, a new kind of urban conflict is unfolding â€“ one that pits human residents against their futuristic, driverless neighbors: Waymo robotaxis.

At the heart of the dispute are Waymo's 24/7 charging lots, established near residential areas. Residents report being driven "mad" by the incessant noise and bright lights emanating from these hubs. The chorus of backup beeps, the hum of human attendants vacuuming cars, and the general commotion are keeping people awake at night, leading to widespread frustration and sleep deprivation.

Some disgruntled locals have taken matters into their own hands, forming a group known as "stackers." Masked and operating under the cover of darkness, they intentionally obstruct the robotaxis' path, forcing them to queue up and disrupting the constant activity at the lots. This direct action, though unusual, underscores the depth of their frustration.

Residents have also attempted to engage with city officials, but feel their concerns have been met with a lack of clarity and inadequate action. The situation highlights a regulatory vacuum: city authorities claim they lack jurisdiction over Waymo's operations, pointing instead to state agencies like the California Public Utilities Commission and the Department of Motor Vehicles. These state bodies, however, seem primarily focused on passenger safety, leaving a gap in addressing the public nuisance and quality of life issues raised by residents. Existing laws, such as noise ordinances or parking regulations, prove difficult to apply effectively to autonomous vehicles, revealing the urgent need for updated legislation.

Waymo, for its part, states it is working to be a "good neighbor" and is in ongoing conversations with the city. They have implemented some mitigation measures, including using quieter vacuums, limiting vehicle speeds in alleys, restricting late-night use of one lot, and even planting bamboo as a noise buffer. Yet, residents maintain these efforts are insufficient, and the disturbances persist.

Experts view the Santa Monica standoff as a microcosm of the broader challenges society faces as artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into the physical world. It raises critical questions about how cities and communities can effectively regulate and coexist with autonomous technologies. The conflict underscores the importance of public consultation and proactive regulatory frameworks *before* new AI systems are deployed at scale, particularly in public spaces.

The battle in Santa Monica serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us that as we rush towards an AI-driven future, the impact on human lives and communities must be a central consideration, not an afterthought.
