### Intentional Attack Injures Dozens in Los Angeles

A night out in East Hollywood turned into a scene of horror early Saturday morning when a driver deliberately plowed a vehicle into a large crowd outside a popular nightclub on Santa Monica Boulevard. At least 30 people were injured in the incident, which police believe was intentional.

According to the Los Angeles Fire Department and police reports, the event occurred around 2 a.m. as people were gathered outside The Vermont Hollywood music venue. Of the 30 people injured, seven are reported to be in critical condition and another six in serious condition. The victims were primarily young adults in their 20s and 30s.

### A Violent Escalation

Law enforcement sources indicate that the driver had been ejected from the nightclub earlier in the evening for being disruptive. Following the crash, the situation escalated further. Bystanders dragged the driver from his vehicle and began to assault him. In the ensuing chaos, another individual in the crowd shot the driver before fleeing the scene.

The driver was transported to a local hospital for treatment and has since been arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Police are now searching for the individual who shot him.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the incident a "heartbreaking tragedy" and stated that a full investigation is underway. "The hearts of Angelenos are with all of the victims impacted this morning," she said in a statement.

The investigation remains active as authorities continue to piece together the events of this violent night.
