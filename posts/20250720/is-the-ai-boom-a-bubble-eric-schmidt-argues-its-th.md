Skyrocketing valuations, startups fueled by billions in funding before turning a profit, and a relentless media buzz that feels eerily similar to the dot-com era. The question is on every investor's mind: Is the artificial intelligence boom an unsustainable bubble destined to pop?

According to one of the tech world's most influential figures, the answer is no. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has weighed in, acknowledging that while the industry's hype can sound like "classic bubble" talk, he believes a collapse is "unlikely." His reasoning pivots away from market speculation and toward the fundamental nature of the technology itself.

### The Real Bottleneck: Power Grids, Not Profits

Schmidt's core argument is that the AI boom is grounded in tangible, real-world demand that is already straining our physical infrastructure. He has repeatedly warned that the true limiting factor for AI's growth isn't a lack of funding or sky-high chip prices, but a looming energy shortage.

He argues that the massive, and growing, electricity consumption of AI data centers is not a flaw but direct evidence of the technology's immense utility. Unlike past bubbles built on speculative metrics, this boom is driven by computational power so intense it presents a real-world engineering and resource challenge. When the primary constraint is a physical resource like energy, it signals a level of demand and utility that goes far beyond hype.

### More Than a Tech Trend: A Geopolitical Force

Further cementing his view, Schmidt points to AI's critical role in national security and global strategy. His recent AI Expo in Washington D.C. heavily featured applications in defense, military robotics, and intelligence. This focus demonstrates that AI is not just a consumer fad or a business efficiency tool; it's a foundational technology that is reshaping geopolitics.

When a technology becomes central to a nation's defense and strategic vision, it achieves a level of importance and staying power that speculative market trends lack. This integration into serious, long-term government planning grounds the AI revolution in reality.

### Hype vs. Reality: A Foundational Shift

Of course, skepticism is warranted. Many point to the dizzying valuations of AI startups that have yet to demonstrate a clear path to profitability. Schmidt's argument doesn't ignore this market froth, but it contextualizes it.

He frames the AI revolution as a fundamental technological shift on par with the invention of the internet. While some companies in this new landscape will inevitably fail—just as they did in the dot-com era—the underlying technology and the value it creates will persist and grow. For Schmidt, the story isn't about the speculative froth on the surface, but the powerful, transformative, and resource-intensive foundation beneath.
