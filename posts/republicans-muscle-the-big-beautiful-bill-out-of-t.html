The bill, a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term domestic agenda, features substantial tax cuts amounting to nearly $5 trillion, offset by approximately $1 trillion in cuts to crucial food and healthcare programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe path to committee passage was not without its hurdles. An earlier attempt to advance the bill failed on Friday, largely due to opposition from a bloc of fiscal conservatives concerned about the spending and deficit implications. These 'fiscal hawks' had voiced strong dissent, with some reportedly leaving committee hearings in protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, proponents of the bill regrouped, and in an unusual late-night session on Sunday, they managed to garner enough support to push the legislation through the committee. While the specific concessions or agreements that shifted the votes are not fully detailed, the successful passage demonstrates the leadership's ability to navigate dissenting voices within the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the late-night success, not all Republicans fell in line. Reports indicate that some members still voted against advancing the bill, underscoring the persistent ideological divide on fiscal matters within the GOP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advancement out of the Budget Committee marks a significant step for the 'big beautiful bill,' sending it closer to a potential floor vote. The legislative process, particularly for such a comprehensive and impactful bill, remains complex and subject to further debate and changes as it moves forward through Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Republicans Muscle the 'Big Beautiful Bill' Out of the Budget Committee in Late-Night Vote","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-19T08:37:12Z","summary":"After initial resistance, a key Republican legislative package dubbed the 'big beautiful bill,' which includes significant tax cuts and spending reductions, was advanced out of the House Budget Committee following a late-night vote.","tags":["Republican Party","Legislation","House Budget Committee","Tax Cuts","Government Spending","US Politics"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"republicans-muscle-the-big-beautiful-bill-out-of-t"},"buildId":"iRAnNq28d29FYwqBeLtKG","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
