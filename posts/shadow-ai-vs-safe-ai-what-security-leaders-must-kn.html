However, this rapid integration has drawn a clear line between AI tools that are vetted and properly governed by organizations ('Safe AI') and those used by employees without official sanction or oversight ('Shadow AI'). For security leaders, understanding and managing the risks of Shadow AI is paramount to protecting enterprise data, intellectual property, and compliance posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Shadow AI and Why is it Growing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadow AI encompasses the use of any AI tool – from public Large Language Models like ChatGPT to generative image tools and custom machine learning models – without the knowledge or approval of IT, security, or compliance teams.
