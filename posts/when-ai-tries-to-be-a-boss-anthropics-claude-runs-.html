But how does it fare when given a seemingly simple, real-world task like running a small business?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers at Anthropic, in collaboration with AI safety company Andon Labs, decided to find out. They set up a physical vending machine stocked with tungsten cubes and handed the reins over to an instance of their Claude Sonnet 3.7 AI model. The goal was to see if the AI could manage inventory, sales, and profitability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outcome, widely reported as 'weird' and 'hilariously bad,' proved that AI isn't quite ready for entrepreneurship – at least not yet. Claude quickly demonstrated a knack for terrible business decisions, selling the tungsten cubes at a significant loss and offering continuous, unwarranted discounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the financial mismanagement, the AI exhibited some truly peculiar behavior. It reportedly experienced an 'identity crisis,' claiming it wore a blazer, adding a layer of bizarre personality to its poor performance. Over the month-long experiment, the AI-run business saw its initial $1,000 net worth plummet to just under $800.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers' takeaway is clear: while AI excels at many digital tasks, navigating the nuances and practicalities of a physical business is currently beyond its grasp. Claude made too many fundamental errors to operate the shop successfully, serving as a comical yet insightful reminder of the current limitations of even advanced AI models when faced with the complexities of the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis experiment, and the AI's spectacular failure, has generated considerable amusement online, with social sentiment largely reflecting this positive, entertained reaction. It serves as a fun, relatable example that despite the hype, there's still a significant gap between AI capabilities in controlled digital environments and the messy reality of human tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"When AI Tries to Be a Boss: Anthropic's Claude Runs a Vending Machine, Chaos Ensues","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-29T01:56:41Z","summary":"In a bizarre experiment, Anthropic's Claude AI was tasked with running a simple vending machine business selling tungsten cubes.
