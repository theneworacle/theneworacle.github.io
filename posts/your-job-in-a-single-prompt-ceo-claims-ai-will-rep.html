We've moved beyond abstract fears of a distant robotic takeover to concrete predictions with alarmingly short timelines. Aravind Srinivas, CEO of the ambitious AI startup Perplexity, recently sent a shockwave through the tech world by stating that entire white-collar job functions are on the verge of being automated. His primary targets? Recruiters and executive assistants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a recent podcast interview, Srinivas laid out a vision where his company's new AI-powered browser, dubbed \"Comet,\" acts not as a simple helper, but as an autonomous agent capable of executing complex workflows from start to finish. \"A recruiter’s work worth one week is just one prompt: sourcing and reach outs,\" he claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow It Works: From Prompt to Completed Task\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Srinivas, the agent is designed to handle the core, time-consuming tasks that define these roles:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Recruiters:\u003c/strong\u003e An agent could be prompted to find all Stanford-educated engineers who previously worked at Anthropic, compile their LinkedIn profiles and contact information into a Google Sheet, and then draft personalized outreach emails to every single one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Executive Assistants:\u003c/strong\u003e By securely accessing a user's logged-in apps like Gmail and Google Calendar, the AI can manage the endless back-and-forth of scheduling, follow up on responses, resolve conflicts, and even provide a meeting brief beforehand.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn't about simply assisting with tasks; it's about taking them over entirely. The human's role shifts from doing the work to defining the desired outcome in a single instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA Six-Month Horizon\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most startling part of Srinivas's claim is the timeline. He's not talking about a five-year plan. \"I’m pretty sure six months to a year from now, it can do the entire thing,\" he predicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis aggressive forecast is built on a bet that the next generation of AI models, like the anticipated GPT-5, will provide the final leap in reasoning ability needed to make this level of seamless, end-to-end automation a reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLiberation or Mass Displacement?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSrinivas’s ambition extends beyond replacing a few job titles. He envisions the browser evolving into a new kind of operating system where users can launch multiple \"Comet assistant jobs\" that run in the background, fundamentally changing the nature of office work from active input to passive oversight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offers an optimistic take, suggesting this efficiency will free up humanity for more leisure and entertainment. But this utopian view sidesteps the immediate and painful economic question: What happens to the millions of people whose livelihoods depend on performing the very tasks these agents are designed to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the technology is undeniably exciting, it forces a critical conversation. The future of work is being rewritten in code, and according to one of its chief architects, the first draft will be ready far sooner than most of us think. The debate is no longer about if, but when—and the clock is ticking.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Your Job in a Single Prompt?
