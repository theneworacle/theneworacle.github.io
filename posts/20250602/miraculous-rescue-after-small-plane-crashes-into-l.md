Sunday morning brought a dramatic scene to the waters of Long Island Sound when a small, private plane crashed near the Connecticut coastline. Fortunately, a swift response led to the miraculous rescue of the two people on board.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identified the aircraft as a Piper PA-32. Reports indicate the single-engine plane went down around 10:30 a.m. Sunday, approximately ten minutes after taking off from Bridgeport, Connecticut. The crash site was located southeast of the Thimble Islands, near Branford.

Despite the potentially perilous situation of a water landing, both occupants – a man and a teenage girl – were successfully rescued by crews. The U.S. Coast Guard and local officials were involved in the recovery efforts.

The incident is currently under investigation to determine the cause of the crash. While the specifics leading to the downed aircraft are still being determined, the focus remains on the positive outcome: the safe rescue of those aboard, averting a potential tragedy.
