A shocking act of violence unfolded on a pedestrian mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon when a suspect allegedly deployed a "makeshift flamethrower" against a crowd gathered for a pro-Israel demonstration.

Authorities and U.S. politicians have swiftly condemned the incident, classifying it as a "targeted terror attack" and an "act of vile antisemitism." The demonstration targeted by the attack was reportedly advocating for the release of hostages in Gaza.

According to initial reports, eight people sustained injuries during the assault. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been taken into custody and booked on a range of charges, including murder and assault.

Multiple sources indicate that the suspect reportedly yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack. The FBI is involved in the ongoing investigation into the motive and circumstances surrounding the incident.

The attack has drawn widespread condemnation from various groups, including Jewish organizations and lawmakers, who highlighted the antisemitic nature of the assault on a group supporting Israel.

The incident underscores the concerning rise of politically and ideologically motivated violence and the need for continued vigilance and efforts to combat hate.

Soliman remains in custody facing serious charges as the investigation continues to piece together the full picture of this disturbing event.
