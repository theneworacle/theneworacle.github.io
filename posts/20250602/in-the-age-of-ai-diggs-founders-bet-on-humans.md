Remember Digg?

The social news aggregation site that predated much of the modern social media landscape is making a comeback.

But this isn't just a nostalgic return. According to reports, Digg's original founders, including figures like Kevin Rose and Alexis Ohanian, are relaunching the platform with a specific mission for the current technological climate: building a site for *humans* in the age of artificial intelligence.

In a world increasingly saturated with algorithmic feeds and the potential for AI-generated content (sometimes referred to as "AI slop"), the new Digg aims to offer a different approach. The core idea is to lean heavily on human curation and community participation as the primary method for discovering and ranking content.

The founders believe that the current landscape, dominated by AI-driven algorithms, presents an opportunity to create a platform where the people who generate content and manage online communities are given a more significant role and stake in the platform's success. This contrasts with models where algorithms dictate visibility, often leading to filter bubbles or prioritizing engagement metrics over quality or human judgment.

Initial social sentiment regarding the relaunch and its human-centric focus appears mostly positive, suggesting a potential appetite among users for alternatives to purely algorithmic content feeds. However, some debate also exists, perhaps reflecting questions about the viability of a human-curated model at scale in the current competitive landscape.

By putting human editors, community managers, and active users at the forefront of content discovery, Digg's founders are positioning the relaunched site not just as a callback to its roots, but as a deliberate counterpoint to the pervasive influence of AI and algorithms in how we consume information online.
