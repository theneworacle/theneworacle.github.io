The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence continues to spark widespread debate about its impact on employment. Will AI lead to mass job losses, or will it usher in a new era of work?

Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind and a leading figure in AI research, weighs in on this critical question. According to recent reports, Hassabis holds a nuanced view: he believes that while AI will undoubtedly cause disruption across various sectors, it will also be a powerful engine for creating **new and "very valuable jobs."**

This perspective aligns with his recent calls for the younger generation to prepare for an AI-transformed world. Hassabis has specifically urged teenagers and students to become proficient in AI technologies, metaphorically referring to them as future **"AI ninjas."** The core message is clear: developing a strong understanding and practical skills in AI will be crucial for navigating and succeeding in the evolving job landscape.

While some forecasts suggest significant workplace disruption could occur within the next five years, Hassabis also reportedly predicts the potential arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within a decade. He foresees AGI leading to the creation of entirely new, engaging types of jobs, even as existing roles are transformed or automated.

Hassabis's advice for students today? Focus on coding and immerse yourself in learning and utilizing AI technologies. This preparation, he suggests, will equip individuals with the adaptability and expertise needed to thrive in the industries of tomorrow.

This outlook, while generating discussion, appears to be met with a generally positive sentiment online, reflecting a growing recognition that adapting to AI, rather than fearing it, is key to future success.
