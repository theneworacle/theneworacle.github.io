The market rally is largely attributed to two key factors: easing trade tensions and increasing bets on a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOptimism for potential trade agreements has provided a significant tailwind for the market. Coupled with this, economic data hinting at potential shifts in monetary policy has bolstered investor confidence. CME's FedWatch tool indicates a strong probability of a September rate cut, with some analysts even seeing a possibility for a move in July.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndividual stocks also saw notable movements, with some AI-related companies continuing their upward trend. The positive sentiment, although accompanied by some debate on social media, reflects a market eager for favorable trade conditions and accommodative monetary policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the rally is broad, driven by these macroeconomic factors, specific sector performance varied. Consumer discretionary stocks led gains in the S\u0026#x26;P 500, while energy lagged.
