summary: "The federal government's AI Action Plan isn't just a suggestion; it's a well-funded mandate. For colleges and universities, the question is no longer *if* they should engage with AI, but *how*. The answer lies in agentic AI, which offers practical workflows for securing funding, aligning with workforce needs, and embedding ethics at scale."

### A Call to Action for Higher Education

The U.S. government's new AI Action Plan has made one thing abundantly clear: artificial intelligence is now considered national infrastructure. With over $13 billion earmarked for AI-related education and workforce development, the pressure is on for colleges and universities to move from discussion to implementation. For institutions that have spent years analyzing problems, the time for mere reflection is over. The era of AI requires action.

But what does action look like? According to a recent analysis in *Forbes*, the key lies in leveraging **agentic AI**—semi-autonomous systems designed to execute complex, multi-step workflows with human oversight. This technology is the bridge between a strategic plan and a deliverable program, offering a tangible way for institutions to meet the fast-rising expectations of government, employers, and students.

### A Blueprint for Implementation: Three Agentic Workflows

Instead of getting lost in abstract strategy, institutions can implement practical, agentic workflows to seize the opportunities presented by the AI Action Plan. Here are three powerful examples:

#### 1. The AI Infrastructure Mapper
To compete for federal funding, universities must demonstrate how they are building a direct pipeline from college to career. For example, with the U.S. facing a shortage of nearly 67,000 semiconductor workers by 2030, the CHIPS & Science Act is ready to fund institutions with evidence-based talent development plans. An **AI Infrastructure Mapper** can automate this process by scanning course catalogs, labor market data, and campus infrastructure to identify where talent pipelines exist and where they need to be built. This provides the data-driven backbone for compelling grant proposals and strategic program design.

#### 2. The Grant Alignment Advisor
Institutions often lose out on grants not because their ideas are poor, but because their proposals aren't aligned with the funder's specific language and values. An **agentic Grant Alignment Advisor** can be a game-changer. This tool continuously scans Requests for Proposals (RFPs) from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Labor, and other agencies, matching solicitations to existing university initiatives. It can help rewrite objectives and fill in gaps, ensuring the proposal perfectly mirrors the priorities of the funder, dramatically increasing the odds of success.

#### 3. The Responsible AI Course Co-Designer
AI fluency, paired with ethical reasoning, is now one of the most sought-after skills by corporate recruiters. Universities must embed AI ethics into their curriculum, but this can be a slow process. A **Responsible AI Course Co-Designer** accelerates this by cross-referencing global AI ethics frameworks (from NIST to OECD) to suggest course structures, case studies, and assessments. It can take a six-month curriculum design sprint and get it 80% of the way there in a single day, ensuring that institutions can build AI capacity both rapidly and responsibly.

### From Theory to Practice

This shift is not just theoretical; it's already happening. As reported by *Campus Technology*, the student success nonprofit InsideTrack is now piloting an agentic AI tool, developed with support from Salesforce, to analyze coaching interactions and surface insights that help staff support students more effectively. This real-world application demonstrates that organizations are moving beyond buzzwords and using agentic AI to solve concrete problems in education.

The AI Action Plan is a catalyst. By embracing agentic AI, higher education institutions can move from a reactive stance to a proactive one, securing vital funding, preparing a future-ready workforce, and shaping the responsible development of technology for generations to come.
