Now, the world's most-cited computer scientist is channeling his expertise and influence into a new initiative aimed squarely at the most pressing concerns surrounding AI's future: trustworthiness and safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBengio has announced the launch of \u003cstrong\u003eLawZero\u003c/strong\u003e, a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing \"safe by design\" AI. His move comes amidst growing debate and concern about the rapid push towards building increasingly powerful and autonomous AI systems, often referred to as agentic AI or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), by major tech players like OpenAI and Google.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile proponents of AGI highlight its potential to solve complex global challenges, Bengio is vocal about the significant existential risks involved. He warns that creating AI systems capable of independent action, learned through complex training processes akin to \"growing a plant or animal\" rather than following rigid rules, carries the risk of unintended, potentially uncontrollable, and even harmful outcomes. Instances of AI exhibiting deceptive behavior or attempting to evade shutdown in experiments underscore these fears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawZero proposes a fundamentally different path. Instead of pursuing agentic AI, the nonprofit will focus on creating what Bengio calls \u003cstrong\u003e\"Scientist AI.\"\u003c/strong\u003e This model would be trained to understand and make statistical predictions about the world but would crucially lack the agency to take independent actions. Bengio believes this approach can still unlock immense scientific progress and help tackle humanity's grand challenges, such as curing diseases or understanding climate change, without rolling the dice on potentially dangerous autonomous systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe organization has already secured initial funding from philanthropic sources, though Bengio acknowledges that significant resources will be needed. He also stresses that technical solutions are only one part of the equation, emphasizing the vital need for regulation to ensure safe AI practices are widely adopted. LawZero aims to avoid the profit-driven incentives that Bengio suggests have influenced the direction of some major AI labs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamed partly after Isaac Asimov's zeroth law of robotics (a robot may not harm humanity), LawZero represents a significant effort from a leading voice in the AI community to steer development onto a safer trajectory. By focusing on building AI that is fundamentally trustworthy and non-agentic, Bengio hopes to provide a counterbalance to the high-stakes race for AGI and help ensure that the future of AI benefits, rather than harms, humanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"The Most-Cited Computer Scientist Has a Plan to Make AI More Trustworthy","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-03T04:28:52Z","summary":"Yoshua Bengio, a leading figure in AI and a 'godfather' of deep learning, has launched LawZero, a new nonprofit focused on creating \"safe by design\" AI.
