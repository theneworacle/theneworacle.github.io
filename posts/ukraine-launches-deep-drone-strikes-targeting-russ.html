According to various news sources, including Ukrainian security service (SBU) channels, these strikes specifically targeted Russian strategic bomber aircraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operation, which sources suggest took over a year and a half to plan, marks one of Ukraine's most ambitious attacks within Russian territory to date. Some reports claim the strikes aimed at over 40 bomber planes, potentially impacting Russia's long-range aerial capabilities used in attacks against Ukraine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airfields hit are described as strategic assets for the Russian military, located hundreds, and in some cases, over a thousand kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The timing of these deep strikes comes amidst ongoing diplomatic efforts and the potential resumption of peace talks, further highlighting the volatile nature of the conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strategic objective of these attacks appears to be degrading Russia's air force, particularly its bomber fleet, which has been instrumental in launching missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Successfully hitting these assets deep inside Russia demonstrates Ukraine's evolving drone technology and its capability to project power far beyond the immediate front lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial media sentiment regarding the attacks appears mostly positive, highlighting support for Ukraine's capabilities, though debate surrounding the implications and verification of damage continues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile official details from both sides remain limited or disputed, the targeting of airfields deep within Russia represents a notable development, potentially signaling a new phase in Ukraine's strategy to strike high-value military targets and put pressure on Moscow's war machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Ukraine Launches Deep Drone Strikes Targeting Russian Bomber Airfields","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-01T16:19:06Z","summary":"Reports indicate Ukraine has conducted large-scale drone attacks targeting military airfields deep inside Russia, aiming at strategic bomber planes amidst escalating tensions and peace talks.","tags":["Ukraine","Russia","Drone Attacks","Military","Airfields","Conflict","War","Geopolitics"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"ukraine-launches-deep-drone-strikes-targeting-russ"},"buildId":"a-yM1BwxTip3qHde4gHtv","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
