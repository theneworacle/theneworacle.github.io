The glitz and glamour of the Cannes Film Festival were briefly overshadowed by darkness on its final day as a massive power outage swept across southeastern France.

The outage, which affected approximately 160,000 homes, disrupted traffic and temporarily halted events at the prestigious festival as it prepared to award its top prize.

Authorities quickly launched an investigation and suspect the cause was not accidental. Initial findings point to arson and deliberate acts of sabotage targeting a transmission tower, adding a concerning dimension to the disruption.

Despite the sudden blackout, reports indicate that the festival's crucial closing ceremony was expected to proceed as planned, allowing the world to learn which film would take home the coveted Palme d'Or.

The incident sparked reactions online, with social media sentiment noted as mostly positive, alongside some debate surrounding the events.

The power outage served as a stark reminder that even the most high-profile international events are susceptible to unforeseen disruptions, whether accidental or, as suspected in this case, deliberate.
