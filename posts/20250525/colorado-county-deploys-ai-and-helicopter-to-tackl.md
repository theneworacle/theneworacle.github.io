Douglas County, Colorado, is taking a high-tech approach to combating the increasing threat of wildfires. The county has announced a $1.5 million investment to acquire a dedicated firefighting helicopter and implement artificial intelligence-powered detection cameras.

This strategic move positions Douglas County as the only county in Colorado with its own year-round, on-call aerial firefighting team. The newly acquired Type 2 helicopter boasts the capacity to drop up to 300 gallons of water in a single pass, offering rapid response capabilities.

The integration of Pano AI camera technology is also a key component of the county's enhanced defense system. These cameras have already demonstrated their effectiveness, having been credited with the swift detection and containment of a wildfire in the Bennett Mountain area last year.

County officials emphasized the proactive nature of this investment. "We’re not waiting for disaster to strike before we act,” said Douglas County Sheriff Darren Weekly in a news release. “We’re building a wildfire response system that uses every tool available to protect lives, property and our natural resources.”

Commissioner Abe Laydon highlighted the dedication of resources, stating the county secured access to the helicopter and crew on standby throughout the year.

The initiative underscores the growing role of technology, particularly AI, in emergency response and disaster management, providing crucial early detection and facilitating quicker, more effective firefighting efforts as wildfire seasons become more challenging.
