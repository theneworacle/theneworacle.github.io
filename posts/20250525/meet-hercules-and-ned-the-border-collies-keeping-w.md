Airports are bustling hubs of activity, with complex operations requiring vigilance and safety protocols at every turn. While ground crews and air traffic controllers manage the flow of aircraft, a different kind of team is hard at work at West Virginia International Yeager Airport (CRW) in Charleston: the wildlife control unit, led by two very special employees.

Meet Hercules and Ned, a dynamic duo of border collies with a vital mission: keeping birds and other wildlife off the runways. Bird and wildlife strikes pose a significant threat to aviation safety, causing costly damage to aircraft and potentially endangering lives. According to reports, bird strikes account for millions of dollars in damages at airports across the U.S. every year.

That's where Hercules, an 8-year-old seasoned veteran, and his 3-year-old protégé, Ned, come in. Alongside their dedicated handler, Chris Keyser, these intelligent and energetic dogs conduct daily patrols. Their natural herding instincts and relentless energy make them perfect for the job, safely deterring animals from encroaching on critical operational areas.

Unlike methods that might harm wildlife, the collies' presence and active herding encourage animals to find safer habitats away from the runways. Hercules, having honed his skills over years, is now passing on his expertise to Ned, ensuring the program's continued success.

The use of working dogs like Hercules and Ned for airport wildlife management is a testament to innovative and effective solutions for a persistent problem. Their dedication not only protects aircraft and passengers but also offers a heartwarming glimpse into the diverse roles animals play in contributing to public safety. Their story has captured public attention, largely sparking positive sentiment for these hardworking pups.

So, the next time you're flying into or out of Charleston, remember the furry guardians patrolling the perimeter, making sure the skies – and runways – are safe for your journey.
