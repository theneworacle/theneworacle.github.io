Douglas County, Colorado, is taking a significant step forward in its wildfire preparedness and response, unveiling a new suite of advanced tools including a dedicated firefighting helicopter and artificial intelligence-powered detection cameras.

County officials recently showcased the new resources, which are part of a proactive strategy to detect and contain wildfires more rapidly.

A centerpiece of this enhanced capability is a Type 2 firefighting helicopter. Secured through a $1.5 million contract, this aircraft can drop up to 300 gallons of water at a time. According to a county news release, Douglas County is now the only county in Colorado to have its own dedicated firefighting helicopter and crew available year-round, ensuring a swift aerial response whenever needed.

Complementing the aerial support are Pano AI-backed cameras. These cameras utilize artificial intelligence to scan the landscape and detect potential fire starts early. The technology has already demonstrated its effectiveness, having been credited with the timely discovery and containment of a wildfire in the Bennett Mountain area last year.

“We’re not waiting for disaster to strike before we act,” said Douglas County Sheriff Darren Weekly in a release. “We’re building a wildfire response system that uses every tool available to protect lives, property and our natural resources.”

The investment underscores a commitment to leveraging technology and dedicated resources to mitigate the increasing risk of wildfires, providing residents with a heightened sense of security as fire seasons potentially become more challenging. Early indications from simulated social sentiment suggest the move is largely viewed positively by the public, though some debate exists.
