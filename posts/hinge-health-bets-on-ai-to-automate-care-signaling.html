A key part of the company's strategy and investor appeal is its plan to heavily integrate artificial intelligence (AI) to automate aspects of care delivery and boost revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis move by Hinge Health isn't happening in a vacuum; it reflects a rapidly accelerating trend across the broader healthcare sector. AI is increasingly being adopted not just for administrative tasks, but for more complex functions that directly impact patient care, such as diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient monitoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExperts point to AI's potential to tackle some of healthcare's most persistent challenges, including high costs and accessibility barriers.
