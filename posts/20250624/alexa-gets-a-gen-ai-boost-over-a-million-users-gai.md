Amazon is rolling out a significant update to its popular voice assistant, Alexa, infusing it with generative AI capabilities. This reinvented version, dubbed Alexa+, is currently available to over a million users in an Early Access program.

Alexa+ promises a more intelligent and conversational experience, moving beyond simple commands to offer "agentic AI capabilities" that allow it to perform complex tasks across various applications. This represents a substantial evolution from the original Alexa, aiming to make the assistant more proactive and helpful in daily life.

During the Early Access phase, Alexa+ is free to use. Upon public launch, it will remain free for Amazon Prime members, while non-Prime users will have the option to subscribe for $19.99 per month.

Initial feedback from early access users has been a mix of excitement and typical beta-phase frustrations. Reviewers have noted "pleasant surprises" alongside "frustrating bugs," which is expected from a pre-release product. Despite some hiccups, initial social media sentiment appears mostly positive, with users engaging in discussions about the new features.

This rollout signifies Amazon's commitment to leveraging generative AI to enhance its core products and keep pace in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. While still in development, Alexa+ has the potential to significantly change how users interact with their smart homes and devices.
