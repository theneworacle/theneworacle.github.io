As the only son of Cliff and Clair Huxtable, his portrayal of Theo was more than just a role; it was a cultural touchstone.

This sentiment has been echoed widely on social media, with countless fans expressing that his death feels like \"losing a family member.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner’s career, however, extended far beyond the Huxtable household. He was an accomplished actor and director with credits including \"Malcolm \u0026#x26; Eddie,\" \"The Resident,\" and a powerful role in \"The People v. O.J.

He was more than an actor; he was a welcome presence, a symbol of a cherished television era, and a man who, by all accounts, was as warm and genuine as the character he so famously portrayed.
