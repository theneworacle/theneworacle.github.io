The idea that AI could eventually \"eat McKinsey's lunch\"—performing complex analysis, strategy development, and client recommendations—is a compelling, if daunting, prospect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the current reality of AI adoption presents a more nuanced picture. According to a recent McKinsey report, over 80% of companies embracing AI are \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e yet seeing significant earnings gains. This \"gen AI paradox\" highlights a gap between the rapid advancements in AI technology, particularly in areas like agentic AI, and the slower, more challenging process of implementing these tools to achieve measurable business impact across an entire organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, this implementation gap is creating a surge in demand for the very services consulting firms provide. As companies grapple with how to strategically integrate AI, move beyond simple \"copilot\" tools, and navigate the complexities of data, workflows, and organizational change, they are increasingly turning to consultants for guidance. McKinsey itself has noted that \"AI curiosity is defying [the] consulting slump,\" with a significant portion of their client projects now involving the technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile AI's capabilities continue to evolve rapidly, the path to realizing its full transformative potential within large enterprises is proving to be more complex and time-consuming than initially anticipated. This creates a current opportunity for consulting firms to help clients bridge this gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat's not to say the consulting world is immune to AI's disruptive force in the long run. Firms like McKinsey are also reportedly evaluating the technology's potential impact on their own workforce size. The eventual shift towards more autonomous AI agents capable of managing entire processes could indeed reshape the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for today, the challenge of effective AI implementation is ironically boosting the consulting business, proving that while the AI revolution is coming, it's unfolding on \"enterprise time\" – slower, with more friction, and creating new demands along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Why AI will eat McKinsey's lunch — but not today","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-30T04:37:17Z","summary":"While the long-term potential for AI to disrupt the consulting industry is clear, a new report highlights a 'gen AI paradox': widespread adoption hasn't translated to significant gains for most companies *yet*.
