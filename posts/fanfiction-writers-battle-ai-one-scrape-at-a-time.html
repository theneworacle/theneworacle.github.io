These creators, who pour their time and passion into writing stories inspired by their favorite media and share them freely, are confronting the unwelcome reality of their work being used without consent to train large language models powering generative AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core of the conflict intensified recently when a user scraped 12.6 million fanfics from Archive of Our Own (AO3), a popular online repository, and uploaded the dataset. This action ignited furious reactions across the fanfiction community, with writers viewing it as a direct violation of their established norms – a 'gift economy' where creativity is shared for enjoyment, not commercial exploitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriters express deep frustration and anger, arguing that their work is transformative, building upon existing concepts to create something new, unlike AI which they feel merely 'regurgitates' scraped content. They see the scraping and subsequent use by AI tools as a form of theft, particularly when 'grifters' attempt to profit from models potentially trained on their uncredited labor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response, the community has mobilized. Writers are filing takedown notices under copyright law, debating the ethics online, and developing tools to help authors check if their work has been scraped. Many are taking defensive measures, such as locking their stories so only registered users can access them, or in some cases, deleting their work from the internet entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA notable form of protest has emerged from the 'Omegaverse' subgenre, where writers deliberately flood platforms with highly specific, often nonsensical, terminology to potentially 'pollute' datasets and make them less useful for AI training. While perhaps a long shot, it highlights the community's determination to fight back in creative ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis clash raises significant questions about copyright, consent, and the future of online creative communities in the age of AI. For fanfiction writers, the battle is personal – a fight to protect their creative spaces and ensure their labor is respected, one scrape at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Fanfiction writers battle AI, one scrape at a time","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-23T12:45:47Z","summary":"Fanfiction writers are finding their creative work, often shared freely within a 'gift economy,' being scraped without permission to train AI models.
