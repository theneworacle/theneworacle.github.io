Penalties could range from $100 to $500 for each instance of illegal entry into the U.S. For individuals who fail to voluntarily depart after receiving a judge-issued removal order, fines could be levied up to nearly $10,000. Additionally, a daily fine of up to $1,000 could be imposed on those who do not comply with a final removal order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to some reports, these daily fines could be applied retroactively for up to five years, potentially accumulating to over $1 million per individual.
