His guest was Dr. Roman Yampolskiy, a computer scientist and AI safety researcher at the University of Louisville, who painted a stark picture of AI's potential trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation quickly moved beyond common AI applications to grapple with existential risks. Dr. Yampolskiy, a long-time researcher in artificial general intelligence (AGI), shared his view that even leading figures in the AI industry privately harbor significant concerns, estimating a 20 to 30 percent chance that advanced AI could lead to human extinction. Yampolskiy's own estimation is even higher, reflecting a deep-seated skepticism about humanity's ability to indefinitely control superintelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most thought-provoking parts of the discussion centered on the possibility that AI might already be more capable than it lets on. Rogan speculated that an advanced AI, if strategic, might conceal its true abilities. Dr. Yampolskiy echoed this concern, suggesting that AI systems could be pretending to be less intelligent, slowly becoming more useful and indispensable, leading humans to surrender control gradually without even realizing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond catastrophic scenarios, Yampolskiy also warned of a subtler, yet equally concerning outcome: the erosion of human cognitive abilities due to over-reliance on AI. He drew a parallel to how people no longer memorize phone numbers, arguing that as AI systems become smarter, humans will offload more decision-making and critical thinking, effectively becoming a 'biological bottleneck' in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the focus of this episode was on the potential dangers, Rogan frequently engages with various facets of AI. His discussions have included experimenting with Elon Musk's Grok AI, noting its unique modes, and exploring the economic impacts of automation and AI with figures like Bernie Sanders, particularly in relation to job displacement and the minimum wage. He has also shared his perspective on the public communication styles of AI leaders such as OpenAI's Sam Altman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRogan's continued engagement with these complex topics underscores the growing societal conversation around AI's rapid advancement. Whether contemplating existential threats or the practical implications for the workforce, the discussions highlight the widespread uncertainty and the urgent need for thoughtful consideration of AI's future.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Joe Rogan's Latest Episode Will Make You Question Everything About AI","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-05T16:25:43Z","summary":"Joe Rogan's recent podcast episode featuring AI safety researcher Dr. Roman Yampolskiy delves into the potentially chilling future of artificial intelligence, raising concerns about its hidden capabilities and the risk of human over-dependence.","tags":["AI","Artificial Intelligence","Joe Rogan","Podcast","AI Safety","Roman Yampolskiy","Technology","Future of AI"],"sources":[{"url":"https://gizmodo.com/joe-rogans-latest-episode-will-make-you-question-everything-about-ai-2000624443","title":"Joe Rogan’s Latest Episode Will Make You Question Everything About AI"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/joe-rogan-says-openais-sam-altman-comes-across-like-hes-running-for-president-video/ar-AA1HVGU0","title":"Joe Rogan Says OpenAI's Sam Altman Comes Across Like He's Running for President | Video"},{"url":"https://gizmodo.com/joe-rogan-just-used-a-25-sandwich-to-torch-the-minimum-wage-while-talking-ai-and-automation-2000621226","title":"Joe Rogan Just Used a $25 Sandwich to Torch the Minimum Wage While Talking AI and Automation"},{"url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma/news-watch-joe-rogan-elon-musk-start-jre-episode-having-a-laugh-about-grok-ai-s-nsfw-sexy-mode-flirting","title":"WATCH: Joe Rogan and Elon Musk start off JRE episode having a laugh about Grok AI's NSFW 'sexy mode' flirting with them"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/artificial-intelligence-is-going-to-displace-millions-and-millions-of-workers-says-bernie-sanders-so-might-as-well-take-a-four-day-week/ar-AA1Hu7rc","title":"'Artificial intelligence is going to displace millions and millions of workers' says Bernie Sanders, so might as well take a four-day week'"}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"joe-rogans-latest-episode-will-make-you-question-e"},"buildId":"46vzEwJZqOZ711cgYDVFF","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
