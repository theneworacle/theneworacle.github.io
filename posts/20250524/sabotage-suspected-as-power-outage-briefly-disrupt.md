A major power outage hit southeastern France on Saturday, the final day of the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, causing disruption to traffic and briefly impacting events at the festival.

The outage left approximately 160,000 homes without electricity. While the disruption was felt across the region, including in Cannes, organizers anticipated that the festival's crucial closing ceremony, where the coveted Palme d'Or is awarded, would still go ahead as planned.

Authorities quickly investigated the cause of the widespread blackout and suspect it was the result of deliberate acts of sabotage. Initial reports indicate the outage was caused by arson and damage to a transmission tower.

Despite the concerning nature of the incident, simulated social media sentiment surrounding the event reportedly leaned mostly positive, albeit with some debate.

The incident highlights the vulnerability of critical infrastructure, even in high-profile locations during major international events like the Cannes Film Festival, prompting investigations into the motives behind the suspected sabotage.
