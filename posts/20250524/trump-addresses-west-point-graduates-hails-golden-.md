Former President Donald Trump returned to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to address the graduating class, delivering a commencement speech where he lauded the new officers and championed the state of the American armed forces.

Speaking to the cadets, Trump congratulated them on their achievement, referring to them as "winners" destined for leadership roles in the military. A central theme of his address was the assertion that the United States military is currently in a "golden age," crediting actions taken during his presidency for its strength and capabilities.

The speech comes amidst ongoing discussions regarding initiatives within the military, including the administration's stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Trump reportedly addressed these topics during his remarks, alongside other varied subjects that, according to some reports, included references to trophy wives, golf, and historical figures like Al Capone.

While the full text of the original article was not available for retrieval, broader news coverage confirms these points and highlights the political undertones present in the address.

Online sentiment surrounding the speech, as reflected on social media platforms, appears to be largely positive, with many expressing support for Trump's message to the graduates and his comments on the military. However, like many political addresses, it also generated debate among different segments of the public.
