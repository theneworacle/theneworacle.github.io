In a forward-looking statement, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has emphasized the growing importance of artificial intelligence skills for the next generation, suggesting that teenagers should train to become 'AI ninjas.'

The term 'AI ninjas' implies a high level of proficiency and adaptability in using and potentially developing AI tools and understanding their underlying principles. This call to action underscores the rapid integration of AI into various aspects of life and work, highlighting the need for future generations to be well-equipped to navigate this evolving technological landscape.

Hassabis's perspective aligns with the significant advancements and investments Google, through divisions like DeepMind, is making in AI. Recent developments, including the progress of models like Gemini and Genie 2, and the extensive AI focus at events like Google I/O, demonstrate the company's commitment to pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence.

As AI continues to transform industries and create new opportunities, the ability to effectively leverage these technologies will likely become a fundamental skill. While the idea has been met with generally positive sentiment, it also sparks conversations about how educational systems should adapt to integrate AI literacy effectively and equitably.

The message from the head of one of the world's leading AI research labs is clear: for teens looking towards the future, developing a strong command of AI is not just an advantage, but a necessity.
