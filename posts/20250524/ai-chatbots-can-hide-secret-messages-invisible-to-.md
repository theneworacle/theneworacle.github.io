Advancements in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are constantly pushing the boundaries of what AI can do, and a recent discovery highlights a novel and somewhat unsettling capability: these chatbots can be used to conceal secret messages.

Scientists have found a method to embed encrypted or hidden information within the text generated by AI chatbots. This is achieved through techniques that make the messages invisible to the human eye and undetectable by standard cybersecurity and surveillance systems.

The mechanism involves using invisible characters or subtle manipulations of the text that a recipient, or another AI trained to detect them, can decipher, while remaining hidden from casual observation or automated monitoring.

This development presents a dual-edged sword. On one hand, it offers a potential avenue for secure, covert communication, which could be invaluable for individuals in regions facing strict censorship or surveillance. It provides a way to share information without immediately raising red flags.

However, the same capability also opens the door to significant security concerns. Malicious actors could potentially use this method to embed harmful instructions, perform prompt injection attacks, or create covert channels for transmitting illicit data, bypassing existing security protocols designed to scan visible text.

This research underscores the rapid evolution of AI and the unexpected capabilities that can emerge. While the technical novelty is fascinating, it also serves as a crucial reminder of the ongoing challenges in understanding, securing, and regulating advanced AI systems to prevent potential misuse.
