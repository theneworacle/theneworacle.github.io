President Donald Trump is set to address the graduating class at the United States Military Academy at West Point, a significant moment for the institution and the cadets embarking on their military careers.

This will be President Trump's second time giving the commencement address at West Point. His previous speech in 2020 occurred during the challenging backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and a national reckoning on race, where he notably urged cadets to 'never forget' soldiers who fought a war over slavery.

The upcoming address takes place amidst reported developments, including a tenured professor at West Point who has reportedly resigned ahead of the speech. The professor cited concerns that the academy was abandoning core principles in meeting the current administration's demands.

The commencement address at West Point is a deeply symbolic event, marking the formal entry of new officers into the U.S. Army. The choice of speaker is often scrutinized for its political and institutional implications.

Simulated social sentiment regarding the address appears mostly positive, though some debate is present. As the ceremony approaches, attention will be focused on President Trump's message to the future leaders of the U.S. Army.
