The unofficial start of summer, Memorial Day weekend, is typically marked by travel, outdoor activities, and gatherings. However, for many across the south-central United States, the weekend is kicking off with a different kind of fanfare: a multi-day system of thunderstorms and heavy rainfall.

Forecasters have been tracking this significant weather pattern, which is bringing risks of severe weather and flooding to areas spanning the Plains and parts of the South. Hundreds of thousands were under severe thunderstorm watches as the weekend began, and the threat of disruptive weather is expected to persist through Monday.

This comes as millions of Americans are hitting the road, taking to the skies, or otherwise traveling for the holiday. The combination of increased travel volume and severe weather poses challenges for those with plans in the affected regions.

While temperatures vary across the country – cooler in the Northeast and Midwest, warmer in the West and South – the primary weather concern remains the risk of intense storms, heavy downpours, and potential flooding in the central and southern states.

Travelers and residents in these areas are advised to stay informed about local weather alerts and adjust their plans accordingly to ensure safety throughout the holiday weekend.
