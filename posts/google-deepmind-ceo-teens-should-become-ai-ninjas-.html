Hassabis believes that teenagers should focus on sharpening their skills in using and understanding AI technologies to better navigate and succeed in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis call to action comes from a leader at the forefront of AI development. Hassabis's own work at Google DeepMind includes pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities with models like Gemini, which he suggests could pave the way for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). His view is that while society grapples with the implications of such powerful AI, individuals, particularly young people, must proactively prepare by becoming adept users of these tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHassabis has previously advised university students to brace themselves for significant changes driven by AI. This consistent messaging underscores a belief that AI literacy will soon be as fundamental as traditional skills. The rapid pace of AI advancement, highlighted by projects like DeepMind's Genie 2 (a world-building AI that could aid in training robots), further emphasizes the urgency of this preparation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of equipping teens with advanced AI skills as 'ninjas' has resonated positively with many, sparking discussions about the best ways to integrate AI education into learning and development for younger generations. While there's ongoing debate about the specifics, the core sentiment—that proficiency with AI is crucial for the future—appears to be gaining traction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs AI continues to evolve and integrate into every facet of life, Hassabis's advice serves as a potent reminder: understanding and mastering these powerful tools is not just an advantage, but potentially a necessity for the world's future workforce and citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"Google DeepMind CEO: Teens Should Become AI 'Ninjas' to Thrive in Future","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-24T12:35:24Z","summary":"Demis Hassabis, head of Google DeepMind, is urging teenagers to proactively develop their skills in artificial intelligence, suggesting proficiency with AI tools will be essential for the future.","tags":["AI","Education","Google DeepMind","Demis Hassabis","Future of Work","Teenagers","AI Skills"]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"google-deepmind-ceo-teens-should-become-ai-ninjas-"},"buildId":"YHKZ4f3zXuMz9IVI3xU5z","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
