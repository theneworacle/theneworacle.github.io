In Mali, the steel skeletons of water towers bake in the sun, never to be completed. These are not just abandoned construction sites; they are broken promises. A recent Reuters investigation has uncovered a stark reality: the Trump administration's sweeping decision to slash nearly all U.S. foreign aid has left at least 21 essential water and sanitation projects stalled across 16 countries, transforming symbols of hope into sources of hazard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Human Cost of Halted Projects\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe consequences of these abandoned projects are not abstract.

Seventy-four-year-old farmer Mary Kibachia, whose home was recently inundated, now fears the unfinished canal will make future floods even worse. \"I have no protection from the flooding that the canal will now cause,\" she told reporters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Congo,\u003c/strong\u003e unfinished water kiosks have become playgrounds. But the lack of safe, accessible water forces families to make dangerous journeys. “When we send young girls, they are raped.

A draft U.S. embassy memo from Kenya, cited in the investigation, warns that abandoning these projects poses a significant \u003cstrong\u003e\"reputational risk\"\u003c/strong\u003e for the United States.
