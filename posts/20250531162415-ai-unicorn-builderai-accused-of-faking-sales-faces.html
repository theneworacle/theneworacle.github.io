According to multiple news sources, the company is accused of faking business transactions with Indian firm VerSe Innovation (parent company of content platform Dailyhunt) in a scheme designed to artificially inflate its sales figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alleged practice, known as \"round-tripping,\" involved Builder.ai and VerSe billing each other for similar amounts between 2021 and 2024 without any genuine exchange of goods or services taking place.
