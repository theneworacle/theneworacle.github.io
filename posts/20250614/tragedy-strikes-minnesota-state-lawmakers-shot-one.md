An investigation is underway in Minnesota following a series of shocking and violent attacks that targeted state lawmakers. According to Governor Tim Walz, the incidents appear to be politically motivated.

State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed in one attack. In a separate but related incident, State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were also shot and wounded. They are reported to be out of surgery and expected to survive.

Authorities are actively searching for the suspect, described as a man who impersonated a police officer to gain access to the victims' homes. A manifesto reportedly listing other officials and "No Kings" flyers were found in a vehicle abandoned by the suspect, adding a disturbing layer to the motive behind the violence. The suspect is described as a 57-year-old white male, reportedly wearing body armor and impersonating law enforcement.

The attacks, which occurred in Brooklyn Park and Champlin, have sent shockwaves through the state and drawn condemnation from political figures across the spectrum, who have described them as acts of political extremism and an assault on democracy.

Shelter-in-place orders were issued in areas near the shootings as law enforcement agencies launched a major manhunt involving hundreds of officers. The governor urged people to avoid political rallies while the suspect remains at large.

The investigation is ongoing as authorities work to apprehend the suspect and understand the full scope of the politically motivated violence that has tragically impacted Minnesota's legislative community.
