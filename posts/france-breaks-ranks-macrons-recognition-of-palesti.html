The decision, which Macron stated will be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September, marks a significant departure from the stance of its Western allies and makes France the first G7 nation to take such a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCiting the urgent need to end the war in Gaza and save the civilian population, Macron framed the recognition as part of France's \"historical commitment to a just and durable peace in the Middle East.\" The announcement reflects a growing frustration within Paris over the stalled diplomatic efforts and the deepening humanitarian crisis in the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA World Divided: Reactions Pour In\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe declaration was met with immediate and starkly divided reactions from the international community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIsrael and the United States Respond with Condemnation:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vehemently condemned the decision, stating that it \"rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy.\" In a sharp rebuke, he asserted, \"A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel â€” not to live in peace beside it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEchoing this sentiment, the United States voiced its strong opposition.
