The music world is mourning the loss of Brian Wilson, the visionary co-founder and leader of the iconic Beach Boys, who has died at the age of 82.

Celebrated widely as a pop auteur and musical genius, Wilson's influence stretched far beyond the sun-soaked surf sound that first brought the band fame. He was a master craftsman, known for weaving complex harmonies and intricate soundscapes into timeless classics such as "God Only Knows," "Good Vibrations," and "California Girls."

Wilson's innovative approach to songwriting and production was instrumental in defining not only the sound of The Beach Boys but also the broader landscape of American pop music and the distinctive "California sound."

News of his passing has prompted an outpouring of tributes from fans, fellow musicians, and media outlets alike. Initial reactions across social media show predominantly positive sentiment, reflecting deep grief mixed with widespread appreciation and celebration of his extraordinary life and monumental contributions to music.
