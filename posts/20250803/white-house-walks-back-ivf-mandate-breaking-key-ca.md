### Administration Abandons Plan for IVF Insurance Mandate

In a significant reversal from a key campaign promise, the Trump administration has indicated it has no current plans to mandate that insurance companies cover the cost of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. This decision leaves thousands of American families navigating the high costs of fertility care on their own and appears to contradict President Donald Trump's stated goal of encouraging a national "baby boom."

During his campaign, President Trump pledged to expand access to fertility treatments. He later signed an executive order intended to explore ways to make IVF more affordable. However, the administration now states that it lacks the legal authority to enforce an insurance mandate without new legislation from Congress.

### A Contradiction in Policy

The move has drawn criticism from opponents who point to a disconnect between the administration's rhetoric and its actions. While the President has called for policies that support families and increase the birth rate, critics argue that failing to act on IVF access does the opposite. The high cost of IVF, which can exceed $15,000 per cycle, remains a significant barrier for many.

Furthermore, this decision is viewed alongside other administration policies, such as proposed cuts to Medicaid, that critics say could further strain family finances and healthcare access.

### The Future for Hopeful Parents

Advocates for an IVF mandate argue that insurance coverage is a critical step in making family-building a possibility for all, not just the wealthy. With the White House placing the responsibility on a divided Congress, the path forward for a federal IVF mandate is uncertain.

For now, millions of hopeful parents are left in limbo, facing the steep costs of fertility treatments without the support they were promised. The administration's decision raises questions about its commitment to its own pro-family agenda, leaving a gap between a popular policy idea and executive action.
