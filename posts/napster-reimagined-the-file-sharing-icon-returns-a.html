Infinite Reality, the Florida-based company that acquired Napster for $207 million, is now rebranding itself as Napster Corporation with a bold new focus: AI-powered digital experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis move signals a complete pivot for Infinite Reality, which was previously centered on the metaverse. Now, under the Napster name, the company intends to leverage artificial intelligence and extended reality (xR) to disrupt various sectors, including AI itself, commerce, and culture, according to reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding to the intrigue, the company recently informed investors of a plan offering liquidity by allowing them to sell shares back at a price suggesting a staggering valuation of at least $18 billion.
