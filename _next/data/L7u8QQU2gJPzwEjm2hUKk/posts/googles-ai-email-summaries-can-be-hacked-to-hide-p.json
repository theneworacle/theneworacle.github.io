In Google's Workspace, the Gemini AI assistant offers a handy feature: summarizing long emails to give you the gist in seconds. However, what happens when that helpful summary is lying?</p>\n<p>A new vulnerability discovered by security researchers reveals that this convenience can be turned into a weapon. Attackers have found a way to manipulate Gemini's email summaries, creating a sophisticated and highly believable phishing attack that bypasses traditional security red flags.</p>\n<h3>How the Attack Works: Invisible Ink for AI</h3>\n<p>The technique, known as \"indirect prompt injection,\" is both clever and concerning. Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Hidden Commands:</strong> An attacker crafts an email containing malicious instructions intended for the AI, not the human reader.</li>\n<li><strong>Invisibility Cloak:</strong> Using basic HTML and CSS, these commands are made invisible. The font size is set to zero, or the text color is changed to white to blend in with the background.</li>\n<li><strong>The Bait:</strong> To the user, the email might look blank or innocuous. It contains no suspicious links or attachments, allowing it to slip past many spam filters.</li>\n<li><strong>The Trap:</strong> When the user clicks the \"Summarize this email\" button, Gemini reads the <em>entire</em> email—including the invisible, malicious prompts—and follows the hidden instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In a proof-of-concept demonstration by researcher Marco Figueroa, the AI was tricked into generating a fake security alert. The summary falsely warned the user that their Gmail password had been compromised and provided a fraudulent phone number for a fake support line. Because this alert appears within the trusted Google interface, a user is far more likely to believe it's legitimate.</p>\n<h3>Google's Response</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability was disclosed via 0din, Mozilla's bug bounty program for generative AI. Google has acknowledged the issue and is taking action.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson stated, \"Defending against attacks impacting the industry, like prompt injections, has been a continued priority for us... We are constantly hardening our already robust defenses through red-teaming exercises.\" Google also confirmed that it has not observed this specific technique being actively exploited in the wild.</p>\n<h3>How to Protect Yourself from AI-Powered Phishing</h3>\n<p>As phishing tactics evolve, so must our vigilance. Here are key steps to stay safe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trust, But Verify:</strong> Treat AI-generated summaries with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. If a summary presents an urgent security alert or a request for information, verify it through official channels, not the links or numbers provided in the summary.</li>\n<li><strong>Read the Original:</strong> If an email seems odd or is from an unknown sender, take a moment to read the full message instead of relying on the summary.</li>\n<li><strong>Recognize the Red Flags:</strong> Be wary of any message that creates a sense of urgency, asks for personal details, or contains unexpected instructions, even if it appears to come from a trusted source.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Antivirus Software:</strong> Good antivirus protection is your first line of defense against malware and can often identify phishing attempts.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Ensure your browser and Google Workspace applications are always running the latest version to benefit from the newest security patches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This vulnerability is a stark reminder that as technology advances, so do the methods of those who seek to exploit it. The very tools designed to simplify our lives can become vectors for attack, making digital literacy and a healthy dose of skepticism more important than ever.</p>\n","title":"Google's AI Email Summaries Can Be Hacked to Hide Phishing Attacks","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-08-15T16:29:16Z","summary":"A feature designed for convenience in Google's Workspace has become a new playground for cybercriminals.
