{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"openai-and-jony-ives-first-ai-device-not-a-wearabl","contentHtml":"<p>Mysterious details surrounding the collaboration between OpenAI and legendary Apple designer Jony Ive have started to emerge, thanks to unexpected sources – court filings from a trademark lawsuit. While speculation has been rife about the form of their first joint AI device, these documents provide a crucial clarification: it won't be an in-ear device or a wearable.</p>\n<p>The information surfaced as OpenAI defended itself against a lawsuit brought by Iyo, an audio company developing an \"audio computer\" headphone. According to declarations within the court documents, including one from io's chief hardware officer, Tang Tan, the prototype device currently in development is not a wearable. The filings also indicate a timeline, suggesting the device won't ship until \"at least\" 2026.</p>\n<p>While the first product is confirmed to not be a wearable, the court documents reveal that OpenAI and Ive's design firm, io, did explore various form factors, including purchasing numerous headphone models to understand the market. This suggests a thorough investigation into potential designs before settling on the direction for their initial offering.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit itself, concerning the use of the name \"io\" by OpenAI's hardware team, highlights the intense competition and potential legal hurdles in the rapidly evolving AI hardware space. Despite this legal entanglement, the core development of the device appears to be moving forward.</p>\n<p>Social sentiment surrounding the project remains largely positive, with the public eager to see what the fusion of OpenAI's AI prowess and Jony Ive's design philosophy will produce. While the exact nature of the device is still under wraps, the confirmation that it's not a wearable provides a clearer picture of what to expect – or rather, what <em>not</em> to expect – from this highly anticipated collaboration.</p>\n","title":"OpenAI and Jony Ive's First AI Device: Not a Wearable, Expected 2026","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-24T04:31:49Z","summary":"New details emerging from a trademark lawsuit reveal that the first AI device from OpenAI's collaboration with former Apple design chief Jony Ive will not be a wearable or in-ear device and is slated for a 2026 or later release.","tags":["AI","OpenAI","Jony Ive","Hardware","Technology","Innovation"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/openai/691737/openai-jony-ive-chatgpt-io-ai-device-wearable-headphone-lyo-lawsuit","title":"OpenAI’s first AI device with Jony Ive won’t be a wearable"},{"url":"https://www.digit.in/news/general/openai-and-jony-ives-first-ai-hardware-might-not-be-wearable-court-documents-reveal.html","title":"OpenAI and Jony Ive’s first AI device might not be wearable, court documents reveal"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/court-filings-reveal-openai-and-io-s-early-work-on-an-ai-device/ar-AA1Hhv1s","title":"Court filings reveal OpenAI and io’s early work on an AI device"},{"url":"https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/23/not-a-wearable-court-documents-detail-openais-plans-for-its-ai-hardware-project-with-jony-ive/","title":"‘Not a wearable’, court documents detail OpenAI’s plans for its AI hardware project with Jony Ive"},{"url":"https://gizmodo.com/heres-why-jony-ive-and-openai-pulled-all-the-promos-for-their-ai-doohickey-2000618895/","title":"Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s AI Gadget Won’t Be ChatGPT in Your Ears"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
