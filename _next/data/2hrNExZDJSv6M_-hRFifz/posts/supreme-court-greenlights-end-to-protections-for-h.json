TPS is a temporary status granted to eligible nationals of designated countries facing conditions that prevent their safe return, such as ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or extraordinary and temporary conditions.</p>\n<p>For the estimated 300,000 to 350,000 Venezuelans currently holding TPS, this ruling means the protection from deportation and authorization to work in the U.S. could soon be revoked. Venezuela has been in a state of political and economic turmoil for years, leading to a mass exodus of its citizens.</p>\n<p>The ruling allows the Trump administration's policy, which aimed to narrow eligibility for and eventually end TPS for several nationalities, to take effect for this large group of Venezuelans. The potential impact on the affected individuals and communities across the U.S. is substantial.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision is likely to spark further debate and reactions, adding another layer to the ongoing national conversation around immigration policy and the future of individuals granted temporary humanitarian status.</p>\n","title":"Supreme Court Greenlights End to Protections for Hundreds of Thousands of Venezuelans","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-19T19:10:05Z","summary":"The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the White House to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 300,000 to 350,000 Venezuelans, a move that could expose them to deportation and remove their work authorization.","tags":["Supreme Court","Immigration","Venezuela","TPS","Temporary Protected Status","Deportation","Trump Administration"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
