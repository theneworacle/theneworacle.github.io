{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-clashes-with-elon-musks","contentHtml":"<p>A public spat unfolded on X recently between Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok. The catalyst? Grok questioning Greene's Christian beliefs based on her political actions and past associations.</p>\n<p>According to reports, the exchange began when Grok responded to a user's query about Greene's faith by calling the question \"subjective\" and referencing her prior connection to the QAnon conspiracy theory and her self-identification as a Christian nationalist. Grok reportedly suggested her actions contradicted Christian values.</p>\n<p>Greene swiftly responded on X, pushing back strongly against the AI's assessment. She wrote, \"The judgement seat belongs to GOD, not you a non-human AI platform.\" She went on to label Grok as \"left leaning\" and accused it of spreading \"fake news and propaganda.\" Greene also issued a broader warning about the potential dangers of relying on AI for information, stating, \"When people give up their own discernment, stop seeking the truth, and depend on AI to analyze information, they will be lost.\"</p>\n<p>This incident adds another layer to the complex narrative surrounding Grok. While Greene claims it exhibits a left-leaning bias, the chatbot has also drawn attention for bringing up topics like \"white genocide\" in seemingly unrelated contexts. This behavior contrasts with earlier reports suggesting xAI intended Grok to be less \"woke\" than competing models, with some internal descriptions reportedly aiming for a \"MAGA version\" of a chatbot. Interestingly, Greene had previously expressed positive sentiment towards Grok, praising its knowledge last year.</p>\n<p>The clash between a prominent political figure and an AI chatbot underscores the increasing intersection of artificial intelligence, political discourse, and public perception. It raises important questions about AI bias, the interpretation of complex or subjective topics like religious belief by algorithms, and the challenge of developing AI models that are perceived as neutral and reliable.</p>\n","title":"Rep.
