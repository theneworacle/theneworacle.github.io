Wang in Denver, stems from a legal motion filed by attorneys Christopher I. Kachouroff and Jennifer T. DeMaster in the defamation case brought by former Dominion Voting Systems executive Eric Coomer. Lindell was previously found liable in the case.</p>\n<p>The problematic filing, drafted with the assistance of generative AI, was riddled with errors, including misquoted caselaw and citations to nonexistent cases. Judge Wang determined that the attorneys violated court rules by submitting the document.</p>\n<p>While attorney Kachouroff admitted to using AI to draft the motion, he initially claimed the flawed version was filed inadvertently due to human error. However, Judge Wang found this explanation unpersuasive, noting contradictory statements and the presence of substantive errors even in the supposedly corrected version of the document. She described the attorneys' responses during the sanction hearing as \"troubling and not well-taken.\"</p>\n<p>This incident highlights a growing concern in the legal profession and other fields rapidly adopting AI tools: the critical need for practitioners to verify and validate AI-generated content before it is presented as fact or submitted in official capacities. While AI can be a powerful tool for research and drafting, this case serves as a stark reminder that its outputs are not always reliable and must be subjected to thorough human review.</p>\n","title":"Judge fines Mike Lindell's attorneys for filing AI-generated motion during defamation case","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-08T04:32:24Z","summary":"Two attorneys for MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell have been fined $3,000 each for submitting a legal motion drafted with generative AI that contained fabricated case citations and errors.
