{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"sovereignty-beats-journalism-in-belmont-stakes-rem","contentHtml":"<p>In a highly anticipated showdown that echoed the Kentucky Derby, Sovereignty, the impressive winner of the first leg of the Triple Crown, has once again bested Journalism to claim victory in the 157th running of the Belmont Stakes.</p>\n<p>The historic race took place not at its usual home on Long Island, but at the renowned Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York, for the second consecutive year. Due to the temporary relocation while Belmont Park undergoes significant renovations, the race was contested at a distance of 1 1/4 miles, shorter than the traditional 'Test of the Champion' distance of 1 1/2 miles.</p>\n<p>Sovereignty, a 3-year-old bay colt, entered the race with favorable 2-to-1 odds and delivered on expectations, finishing three lengths ahead of Journalism. This marks the second time this season that the two horses have finished 1-2 in a Triple Crown race, providing a compelling narrative to the 2025 series.</p>\n<p>Trained by Bill Mott and owned by Godolphin, the racing stable of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Sovereignty added another prestigious win to its resume. Jockey Junior Alvarado, who also piloted Sovereignty to victory in the Kentucky Derby, was aboard for the Belmont win. Alvarado is currently appealing a significant fine and suspension related to his ride in the Derby, a detail that has sparked some discussion among racing fans.</p>\n<p>Sovereignty's path to the Belmont victory is notable, being the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness Stakes, and then win the Belmont. Journalism, the Preakness winner and the only horse to run in all three legs this year, entered as the favorite, adding to the drama of the rematch.</p>\n<p>Social media reaction to Sovereignty's win has been largely positive, celebrating the performance of the Kentucky Derby champion and the exciting finish at Saratoga.</p>\n","title":"Sovereignty Beats Journalism in Belmont Stakes Rematch at Saratoga","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-08T01:22:02Z","summary":"Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty claimed victory at the 157th Belmont Stakes held at Saratoga, defeating runner-up Journalism in a thrilling rematch of the Derby finish.","tags":["Horse Racing","Belmont Stakes","Saratoga Race Course","Sovereignty","Journalism","Triple Crown","Bill Mott","Junior Alvarado"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
