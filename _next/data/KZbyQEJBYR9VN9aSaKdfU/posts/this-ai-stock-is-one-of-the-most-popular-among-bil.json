As the leading designer of AI chips, Nvidia's stock has seen remarkable growth, fueled by the surging demand for the hardware powering the AI revolution.</p>\n<p>However, a closer look at the portfolios of some of the world's most successful investors reveals a different favorite emerging in the AI space. According to recent reports, several prominent billionaires are increasingly bullish on Amazon (AMZN), viewing it as a prime opportunity to capitalize on the AI trend.</p>\n<p>Why Amazon?</p>\n<p>Billionaire investors like Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management, Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, and Stephen Mandel Jr. of Lone Pine Capital reportedly hold significant positions in Amazon. Their interest stems from Amazon's multifaceted approach to AI, leveraging it for both internal efficiency and massive external growth:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>E-commerce Optimization:</strong> AI is silently enhancing Amazon's core retail operations. From optimizing delivery routes to streamlining complex fulfillment center logistics, AI helps Amazon reduce costs and improve profitability.</li>\n<li><strong>AWS Dominance:</strong> The most significant AI play for Amazon lies in its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is not just providing the cloud infrastructure where AI models run; it offers a comprehensive suite of AI products and services to its vast customer base. This includes access to AI chips, fully managed platforms for deploying large language models, and tools for building custom AI agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>AWS's AI offerings are proving to be a massive growth driver. The platform recently hit an impressive $117 billion annual revenue run rate, significantly bolstered by its AI portfolio. As the world's leading cloud provider, AWS is uniquely positioned to onboard existing customers onto its AI services seamlessly.</p>\n<p>Beyond AI: A Balanced Investment</p>\n<p>For billionaires, Amazon represents more than just an AI bet. It combines the high-growth potential of its AI initiatives with the stability and competitive advantage of its established e-commerce business. Amazon's strong brand, vast logistics network, and long track record of earnings growth offer a level of security that pure-play AI startups might lack.</p>\n<p>While Nvidia remains a critical player, the focus from these billionaire investors highlights Amazon's growing importance in the AI investment landscape. Their strategy suggests that leveraging AI within a diversified, established business model is a powerful way to benefit from the AI boom.</p>\n","title":"This AI Stock Is One of the Most Popular Among Billionaires Right Now (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-02T08:31:54Z","summary":"While Nvidia often grabs headlines in the AI investment world, several prominent billionaires are quietly placing big bets on a different tech giant for its AI potential: Amazon.
