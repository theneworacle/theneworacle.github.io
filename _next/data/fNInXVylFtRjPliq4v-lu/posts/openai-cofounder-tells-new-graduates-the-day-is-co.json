{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"openai-cofounder-tells-new-graduates-the-day-is-co","contentHtml":"<p>The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence continues to be a dominant theme in technology news, and a recent statement from an OpenAI cofounder has once again brought the potential of advanced AI into sharp focus.</p>\n<p>According to reports, Ilya Sutskever, a cofounder of OpenAI, shared a compelling vision with new graduates: the advent of a day when AI will be capable of executing \"all the things that we can.\" This bold prediction underscores the ambitious trajectory of AI development, particularly in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) â€“ a hypothetical state where AI possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human level.</p>\n<p>Sutskever's remarks resonate with comments from other OpenAI executives. Previously, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap reportedly suggested that AGI could be reached within the next four years. Similarly, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar has spoken about the company's efforts to create AI that can handle tasks that professionals, such as software engineers, find undesirable, effectively multiplying human capabilities.</p>\n<p>The prospect of AI reaching such a level of capability naturally raises questions about the future of work and the potential for significant societal shifts. While some view this as an opportunity for unprecedented productivity and innovation, others express concerns about job displacement and the need for individuals and industries to adapt.</p>\n<p>Simulated social sentiment surrounding such predictions appears to be largely positive, reflecting excitement about AI's potential, though it's accompanied by notable debate regarding the broader implications for employment and how society will navigate a future intertwined with increasingly capable AI systems.</p>\n<p>As AI research and development accelerate, statements like Sutskever's serve as powerful reminders of the transformative potential of this technology and the important conversations we need to continue having about its integration into our lives and the workforce.</p>\n","title":"OpenAI cofounder tells new graduates the day is coming when AI 'will do all the things that we can'","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-09T16:29:46Z","summary":"A leading figure at OpenAI predicts a future where artificial intelligence can perform tasks currently exclusive to humans, sparking discussions about the rapid advancement of AI and its potential impact on the future of work and society.","tags":["AI","AGI","OpenAI","Future of Work","Technology","Innovation","Jobs","Artificial Intelligence"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/openai-cofounder-tells-new-graduates-the-day-is-coming-when-ai-will-do-all-the-things-that-we-can/ar-AA1Gntbb","title":"OpenAI cofounder tells new graduates the day is coming when AI 'will do all the things that we can'"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/humans-have-4-years-before-ai-can-do-everything-they-can-do-openai-coo-says/ar-AA1FJLwV","title":"Humans Have 4 Years Before AI Can Do Everything They Can Do, OpenAI COO Says"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/openai-is-creating-ai-to-do-all-the-things-that-software-engineers-hate-to-do/ar-AA1CYVYI","title":"OpenAI Is Creating AI to Do 'All the Things That Software Engineers Hate to Do'"},{"url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-non-profit-control-public-benefit-corporation-sam-altman-letter-2025-5","title":"OpenAI appears to have decided that transferring control away from its nonprofit isn't worth the hassle after all."},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-in/health/medical/openai-s-former-head-of-agi-readiness-says-that-soon-ai-will-be-able-to-do-anything-on-a-computer-that-a-human-can/ar-AA1toIZy","title":"OpenAI's former head of 'AGI readiness' says that soon AI will be able to do anything on a computer that a human can"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
