According to Attorney General Pam Bondi and various news reports, these charges include human smuggling. Disturbingly, reports indicate that some of the migrants Garcia is alleged to have smuggled have ties to the notorious MS-13 gang.</p>\n<p>The case has drawn attention, partly due to the circumstances of his deportation. Garcia was reportedly sent to an infamous mega-prison in El Salvador under the Trump administration, which had also been reported to have initially defied a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return to the U.S.</p>\n<p>President Trump has commented on Garcia's return, stating that the courts will \"show how horrible this guy is.\" The return ensures that Garcia will now stand trial and face the accusations against him on U.S. soil.</p>\n<p>The situation highlights the complexities and sometimes contentious nature of immigration enforcement and the legal system, particularly when errors in deportation occur. While social media sentiment appears mostly positive regarding his return to face charges, some debate surrounding the case persists.</p>\n","title":"Mistakenly Deported Man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, Returned to US to Face Federal Smuggling Charges","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-07T01:14:32Z","summary":"After being mistakenly deported to El Salvador, Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been returned to the United States to face federal criminal charges, including human smuggling, with reports linking some migrants to MS-13.","tags":["Immigration","Criminal Justice","Human Smuggling","Deportation","MS-13","Legal System","Kilmar Abrego Garcia"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
