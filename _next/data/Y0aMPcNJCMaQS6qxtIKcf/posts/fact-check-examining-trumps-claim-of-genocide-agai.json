According to reports, Trump insisted that a \"genocide\" was being perpetrated against White farmers in South Africa.</p>\n<p>The assertion quickly drew scrutiny and was met with strong disagreement by fact-checkers and international observers. While crime against farmers, like crime against many other groups in South Africa, is a serious concern, fact-checking organizations have widely concluded that the scale and nature of these incidents do not meet the criteria for genocide.</p>\n<p>Reports indicate that the violence against farmers, though tragic, represents a very small percentage of the country's overall crime rate. South Africa faces high levels of crime affecting all racial groups, and classifying attacks on White farmers specifically as a genocide has been deemed a false narrative.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Trump reportedly presented footage he believed supported his claims and discussed the possibility of the U.S. accepting White South African refugees. President Ramaphosa's reaction to Trump's claims was described by one source as \"stunned silence.\"</p>\n<p>This instance highlights the importance of fact-checking claims made by public figures, especially when they involve sensitive issues like ethnic violence and international relations. While the safety of all citizens in South Africa is a valid concern, using the term \"genocide\" without factual basis risks misrepresenting the situation and potentially fueling harmful narratives.</p>\n","title":"Fact Check: Examining Trump's Claim of 'Genocide' Against White Farmers in South Africa","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-21T22:11:54Z","summary":"During a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, former President Trump asserted that a 'genocide' is occurring against White farmers.
