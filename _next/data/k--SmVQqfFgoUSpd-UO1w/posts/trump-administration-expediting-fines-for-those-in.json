{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"trump-administration-expediting-fines-for-those-in","contentHtml":"<p>Recent reports indicate the Trump administration is implementing or planning to implement a policy to expedite the imposition of fines on individuals residing in the United States without legal status. This move is described as part of a broader crackdown on immigration enforcement.</p>\n<p>The proposed fines are substantial and appear designed to penalize various aspects of immigration violations. Penalties could range from $100 to $500 for each instance of illegal entry into the U.S. For individuals who fail to voluntarily depart after receiving a judge-issued removal order, fines could be levied up to nearly $10,000. Additionally, a daily fine of up to $1,000 could be imposed on those who do not comply with a final removal order.</p>\n<p>According to some reports, these daily fines could be applied retroactively for up to five years, potentially accumulating to over $1 million per individual. There is also a possibility that the administration could seek to seize property from those who fail to pay these significant penalties.</p>\n<p>Officials have reportedly suggested that individuals subject to deportation orders should utilize the CBP Home app for \"self-deportation\" to avoid these escalating financial consequences and potentially retain eligibility for future legal immigration. Failure to self-deport could lead to apprehension by the Department of Homeland Security without prior notice.</p>\n<p>Simulated social sentiment regarding this policy appears to be mostly positive, though with some degree of debate.</p>\n","title":"Trump administration expediting fines for those in the US illegally: Exclusive","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-27T12:32:41Z","summary":"The Trump administration is reportedly moving to significantly expedite fines for individuals in the US illegally, with potential penalties reaching thousands of dollars for non-compliance with deportation orders.","tags":["Immigration","Trump Administration","Policy","Fines","Enforcement"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-administration-expediting-fines-for-those-in-the-us-illegally-exclusive/ar-AA1HwE97","title":"Trump administration expediting fines for those in the US illegally: Exclusive"},{"url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-unveils-plan-costing-migrants-massive-fine-every-day-dont-self-deport","title":"Trump admin unveils plan costing migrants massive fine for every day they don't self-deport"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
