Recent actions by industry leaders Anthropic and OpenAI highlight this growing conflict, putting popular AI apps squarely in their crosshairs.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the issue is the dual role of these major labs: they provide the powerful underlying models (like Claude and ChatGPT) via APIs that developers use to build their own products, but they also develop their own end-user applications that can compete directly with those very same customers.</p>\n<h3>Caught in the Middle: Windsurf and Granola</h3>\n<p>Two examples illustrate this dynamic perfectly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anthropic vs. Windsurf:</strong> Windsurf, a popular 'vibe coding' tool, was abruptly cut off from accessing Anthropic's Claude models with very little notice. Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan stated they were willing to pay for the capacity, expressing concern about the broader industry impact. The move is reportedly linked to rumors that OpenAI, Anthropic's main rival, is in talks to acquire Windsurf. Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan was blunt, stating they are prioritizing partners who will sustainably work with them, implying that selling models to a company potentially being acquired by OpenAI would be \"odd.\"</li>\n<li><strong>OpenAI vs. Granola:</strong> OpenAI recently announced a new \"record mode\" for ChatGPT, starting with enterprise accounts, that can transcribe calls and generate meeting notes. This feature directly competes with the core functionality of Granola, a buzzy AI meeting notes app that recently secured significant funding. While Granola has expanded its features, OpenAI adding this capability to ChatGPT's massive user base makes the growth path significantly steeper for the startup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This pattern raises a critical question for the AI ecosystem: can developers truly rely on model providers as stable platforms for building businesses, or must they constantly fear their provider becoming a direct competitor in their specific vertical?</p>\n<h3>The Broader Implications</h3>\n<p>AI investor Zak Kukoff summarized the dilemma well: \"At some point model providers are going to need to decide if they want to be stable platforms or compete for every vertical.\" The current trend suggests they are leaning towards the latter, driven by their own product ambitions and the intense rivalry between the labs.</p>\n<p>This competitive pressure could lead startups to diversify their model dependencies or potentially look to larger incumbent tech companies like Microsoft, Google, or Amazon – who offer both models and broader cloud infrastructure – for more reliable, long-term partnerships. As OpenAI builds teams specifically to help API customers, they face the challenge of fostering innovation on their platform while simultaneously pursuing their own application goals.</p>\n<p>While the article also touches on a related, more optimistic view on AI's impact on engineering jobs (suggesting AI will augment rather than eliminate roles, particularly for those who embrace AI tools), the primary takeaway is the shifting power dynamic between the AI model creators and the app developers building on their technology. This tension will likely continue to shape the AI startup landscape for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the 'crosshairs' moment for apps like Windsurf and Granola serves as a clear signal: building a successful business solely reliant on a major AI lab's API comes with inherent risks in this rapidly evolving, competitive environment.</p>\n","title":"Popular AI apps get caught in the crosshairs of Anthropic and OpenAI","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-07T01:43:57Z","summary":"The giants of AI, Anthropic and OpenAI, are increasingly competing directly with the popular applications built on their models, creating a precarious environment for startups like Windsurf and Granola.","tags":["AI","Anthropic","OpenAI","AI Apps","Startups","Competition","API","Windsurf","Granola","AI Models","Tech Industry"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
