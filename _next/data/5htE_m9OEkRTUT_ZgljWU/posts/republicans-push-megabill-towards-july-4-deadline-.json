{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"republicans-push-megabill-towards-july-4-deadline-","contentHtml":"<p>Senate Republicans are making a determined push to pass a significant tax and spending bill, often referred to as the 'megabill,' aiming to get the legislation to President Trump's desk by a self-imposed July 4th deadline. The effort has initiated a marathon session in the Senate as the GOP leadership works to secure passage.</p>\n<p>However, the path forward is not without its hurdles. Reports indicate internal debate among Republican senators, with some voicing opposition or concerns, particularly regarding proposed changes to Medicaid and the potential impact on the national deficit. These divisions are straining the push for quick passage.</p>\n<p>Recognizing that initial public polling shows the megabill is broadly unpopular, Republican leaders are focusing on their messaging strategy. They believe that while the overall package may not poll well, specific policies contained within the bill are more favorable to the public. The party is encouraging members to stick to a unified messaging script to try and win support.</p>\n<p>Despite the internal dissent and public perception challenges, the effort to pass the bill continues ahead of the rapidly approaching deadline.</p>\n","title":"Republicans Push 'Megabill' Towards July 4 Deadline Amid Internal Debate","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-30T16:20:47Z","summary":"Senate Republicans are in a race against the clock to pass President Trump's sweeping tax and spending package by a self-imposed July 4th deadline, facing internal divisions and public messaging challenges.","tags":["Politics","US Senate","Republican Party","Legislation","Tax Policy","Spending Bill"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/republicans-charge-ahead-with-megabill-s-fate-uncertain/ar-AA1HHcE1","title":"Republicans Charge Ahead With Megabill's Fate Uncertain"},{"url":"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-score/2025/06/30/how-republicans-think-they-can-win-the-megabill-message-00432139","title":"How Republicans think they can win the megabill message"},{"url":"https://ijr.com/two-gop-senators-vote-no-as-trumps-megabill-clears-critical-hurdle/","title":"Two GOP Senators Vote 'No' As Trump's Megabill Clears Critical Hurdle"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/republicans-fight-it-out-on-trump-s-tax-megabill/ar-AA1HDUD6","title":"Republicans Fight It Out on Trump’s Tax Megabill"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/departing-gop-centrist-has-big-decision-on-trump-megabill/ar-AA1HGXXd","title":"Departing GOP Centrist Has Big Decision on Trump Megabill"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
