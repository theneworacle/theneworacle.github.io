{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"operas-new-ai-browser-promises-to-write-code-while","contentHtml":"<p>Opera, known for its innovative browser features, is pushing the boundaries of web browsing with the launch of <strong>Opera Neon</strong>. This isn't just another browser; it's described as an <strong>\"agentic browser\"</strong> powered by integrated AI agents capable of performing complex tasks on the user's behalf.</p>\n<p>The core idea behind Opera Neon is automation and proactive assistance. Instead of just fetching information, its AI agents are designed to understand context and execute specific jobs across the internet. The capabilities highlighted are particularly ambitious, including the ability to <strong>write code for websites and even games</strong>, automate online shopping processes, and generate detailed reports.</p>\n<p>One of the most intriguing claims is that these agents can perform tasks while the user is seemingly inactive or even \"while you are asleep.\" This suggests a level of autonomy and background processing aimed at maximizing efficiency and leveraging downtime.</p>\n<p>However, this advanced functionality comes with a price. Unlike Opera's traditional free browsers, Opera Neon is positioned as a <strong>premium, subscription-based service</strong>, signaling a move towards monetizing cutting-edge AI features.</p>\n<p>The launch has generated significant buzz. Early social media sentiment appears <strong>mostly positive</strong>, with users excited about the potential of an AI-driven browser that can handle tasks autonomously. Yet, there's also <strong>some debate</strong>, likely centering on the subscription model, the reliability and control over autonomous agents, and the implications of a browser that actively works in the background.</p>\n<p>Opera Neon represents a notable step in the evolution of web browsers, shifting the paradigm from a simple interface for accessing information to a proactive, intelligent assistant integrated directly into the browsing experience. As AI agents become more sophisticated, browsers like Neon could redefine how we interact with the internet and delegate digital tasks.</p>\n","title":"Opera's new AI browser promises to write code while you sleep","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-28T12:43:37Z","summary":"Opera has unveiled Opera Neon, a new \"agentic\" AI browser designed to perform tasks like coding websites, shopping, and generating reports autonomously for users, potentially even while they're inactive or \"asleep.\" Available as a premium subscription service, Neon represents a bold step into the future of browser-based AI.","tags":["AI","Browser","Opera","Opera Neon","Agentic AI","Coding","Technology","Subscription"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
