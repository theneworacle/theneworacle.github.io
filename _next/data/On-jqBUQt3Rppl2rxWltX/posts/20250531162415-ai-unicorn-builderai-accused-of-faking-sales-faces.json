According to multiple news sources, the company is accused of faking business transactions with Indian firm VerSe Innovation (parent company of content platform Dailyhunt) in a scheme designed to artificially inflate its sales figures.</p>\n<p>The alleged practice, known as \"round-tripping,\" involved Builder.ai and VerSe billing each other for similar amounts between 2021 and 2024 without any genuine exchange of goods or services taking place. The primary objective, sources suggest, was to create the illusion of significant revenue growth to attract and deceive investors.</p>\n<p>Through this alleged scheme, Builder.ai is said to have gained approximately $60 million from VerSe over the four-year period.</p>\n<p>The fallout from these allegations has been swift and severe. Builder.ai is now reportedly the subject of a US federal probe investigating inflated revenues and possible fraud. Internal audits cited in reports have allegedly uncovered that the company's revenues were overstated by more than 300%. Consequently, Builder.ai has reportedly entered insolvency proceedings.</p>\n<p>The case highlights the intense pressure on startups, particularly in the booming AI sector, to demonstrate rapid growth and profitability, potentially leading to questionable practices. It also serves as a stark reminder for investors to conduct thorough due diligence, even with highly touted and well-funded companies.</p>\n<p>While VerSe has reportedly denied the claims of billing without services, the allegations against Builder.ai point to a significant financial scandal that has brought down a once-promising AI 'unicorn' and underscores the risks lurking beneath inflated valuations in the tech world.</p>\n","title":"AI Unicorn Builder.ai Accused of Faking Sales to Inflate Revenue, Enters Insolvency","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-31T16:24:15Z","summary":"Reports reveal AI startup Builder.ai allegedly engaged in 'round-tripping' with Indian firm VerSe, faking business transactions to inflate sales figures by over 300%.
