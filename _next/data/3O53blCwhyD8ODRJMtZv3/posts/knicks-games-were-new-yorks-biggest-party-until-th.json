Throughout the playoffs, Knicks games haven't just been sporting events; they've been city-wide celebrations, a raucous party fueled by a passionate fanbase hungry for success.</p>\n<p>But then the Indiana Pacers arrived.</p>\n<p>Far from being overwhelmed by the bright lights and deafening cheers of MSG, the Pacers have systematically dismantled the Knicks on their home court, taking a surprising 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference Finals. This isn't just a setback; it's a historic blow for the Knicks, marking the first time in franchise history they've lost the first two games of a playoff series at home.</p>\n<p>The Pacers haven't just crashed the party; they've seemingly shut down the venue. Their cohesive play, offensive efficiency, and surprising ability to outmatch the Knicks' starters have been the story of the series so far. Pascal Siakam, in particular, has been a revelation, putting up a career playoff high of 39 points in a dominant Game 2 performance that underscored Indiana's control.</p>\n<p>The energy that crackled through MSG has been replaced by tension and disbelief among the Knicks faithful. The \"biggest party\" New York basketball has seen in years has been silenced by a determined Pacers squad.</p>\n<p>Now, the series shifts to Indiana.
