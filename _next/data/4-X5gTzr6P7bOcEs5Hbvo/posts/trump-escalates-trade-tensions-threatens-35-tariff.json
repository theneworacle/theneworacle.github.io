{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"trump-escalates-trade-tensions-threatens-35-tariff","contentHtml":"<p>President Donald Trump has signaled a significant escalation in trade tensions with America's northern neighbor, threatening to impose a hefty 35% tariff on certain goods imported from Canada. Announced to take effect on August 1st, this move is reportedly contingent on Canada agreeing to build or manufacture the affected products within the United States.</p>\n<p>This threat represents a dramatic increase from previous top tariff rates, which were around 25% and first imposed in March. It is framed as part of the administration's broader strategy to renegotiate trade deals and encourage domestic production. The on-again, off-again trade disputes between the U.S. and Canada have seen various points of friction, and this latest declaration adds a new layer of complexity to the relationship between two of the world's most important trading partners.</p>\n<p>Initial reactions on social media to the potential tariff increase appear to be mostly positive among some segments, though the issue is also sparking debate. The implications of such a substantial tariff on Canadian industries and American consumers remain a key point of discussion as the August 1st deadline approaches.</p>\n","title":"Trump Escalates Trade Tensions: Threatens 35% Tariff on Canadian Goods","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-11T08:24:19Z","summary":"President Trump has announced a potential 35% tariff on Canadian imports, effective August 1st, tied to a condition for Canada to build or manufacture products in the U.S. This move marks a significant escalation in trade relations.","tags":["Trade","Tariffs","Canada","United States","Donald Trump","Economy","Politics"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-threatens-35-tariff-on-some-canadian-goods/ar-AA1InsDH","title":"Trump Threatens 35% Tariff on Some Canadian Goods"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/trump-drops-new-tariff-threats-to-canada-in-deranged-letter/ar-AA1Io71I","title":"Trump Drops New Tariff Threats to Canada in Deranged Letter"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/trump-threatens-a-35-tariff-on-canadian-goods-and-he-may-double-what-most-other-nations-are-charged/ar-AA1IniF4","title":"Trump threatens a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, and he may double what most other nations are charged"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/trump-threatening-35-tariffs-on-canadian-goods-across-the-board/ar-AA1InbQj","title":"Trump threatening 35% tariffs on Canadian goods across the board"},{"url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/07/10/business/trump-canada-tariffs/","title":"Trump plans to hike tariffs on Canadian goods to 35 percent"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
