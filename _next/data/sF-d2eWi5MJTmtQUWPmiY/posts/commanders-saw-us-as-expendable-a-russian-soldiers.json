A collaborative investigation by independent Russian media outlet Mediazona and the BBC Russian service has put a number to the loss, identifying by name over 119,000 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine. Such a high, verifiable death toll lends significant weight to the sense that soldiers are being used as disposable assets in a grueling war of attrition.</p>\n<p>The strategic pressures on the Russian military machine likely contribute to this grim reality. With Russia pushing for a major strategic victory by advancing on the critical hub city of Pokrovsk, and with its economy reportedly wobbling under the strain of a protracted war, the pressure to achieve objectives on the battlefield is immense. For soldiers on the ground, this translates into high-risk maneuvers and a command structure that may prioritize gains over lives.</p>\n<p>For men like Mikhail Simdyankin, the geopolitical ambitions and strategic goals of a nation are experienced as a direct and personal threat. His story is a powerful reminder of the human element at the center of the conflict, where the cost is measured not just in territory, but in the lives of those who feel they were seen as nothing more than expendable.</p>\n","title":"'Commanders Saw Us as Expendable': A Russian Soldier's View of the War","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-24T04:39:01Z","summary":"A firsthand account from a Russian soldier reveals a grim reality on the front lines in Ukraine, where a large sign-on bonus led to the shocking realization that he and his comrades were viewed as disposable.
