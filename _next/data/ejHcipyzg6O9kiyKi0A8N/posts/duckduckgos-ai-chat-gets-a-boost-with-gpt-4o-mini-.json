{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"duckduckgos-ai-chat-gets-a-boost-with-gpt-4o-mini-","contentHtml":"<p>Privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo is enhancing its artificial intelligence capabilities by integrating OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model into its AI chat feature, Duck.ai. This significant upgrade introduces real-time web access, allowing the AI to provide users with the most current information available on the internet.</p>\n<p>The addition of web access means Duck.ai can now answer questions requiring up-to-date information, such as breaking news, current sports scores, or comparisons of recently released products. Crucially, DuckDuckGo states that when the AI pulls information from the web, it will always cite its sources, and users have the option to manually trigger web access if desired.</p>\n<p>DuckDuckGo emphasizes that this AI expansion maintains the company's core commitment to user privacy. According to DuckDuckGo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The service is <strong>free to use</strong> with <strong>no login or account required</strong>.</li>\n<li>Interactions are <strong>fully anonymized</strong> by proxying, with user IPs hidden and metadata stripped.</li>\n<li>User chats are <strong>never used for AI training</strong> by any of the model providers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond the GPT-4o mini integration, Duck.ai offers users unique flexibility. It allows you to <strong>switch between different AI models</strong> during a single conversation. Users can interact with OpenAI's GPT-4o mini and o3-mini, Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku, Meta's Llama 3.3 70B, and Mistral AI's Mistral Small 3 24B. This feature, highly requested by users, enables comparison of how different models respond to the same query or switching models if the initial response isn't satisfactory.</p>\n<p>This move positions DuckDuckGo's AI chat as a powerful, versatile tool that prioritizes privacy in an increasingly AI-driven world. The upgrade is available now via duck.ai.</p>\n<p>The integration of 'mini' versions of powerful AI models seems to be a growing trend, with OpenAI also recently making GPT-4.1 mini the default model for all ChatGPT users.</p>\n","title":"DuckDuckGo's AI Chat Gets a Boost with GPT-4o mini, Adds Real-Time Web Access","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-21T12:39:20Z","summary":"DuckDuckGo has upgraded its Duck.ai chat feature by integrating OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model, bringing real-time web access and the ability to switch between various AI models, all while upholding its strong commitment to user privacy.","tags":["DuckDuckGo","AI","GPT-4o mini","Search Engine","Privacy","OpenAI","Large Language Models","Tech News","Duck.ai"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
