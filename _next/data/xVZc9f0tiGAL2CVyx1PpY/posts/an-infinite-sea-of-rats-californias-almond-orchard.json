Farmers, some with decades of experience, report they have \"never seen anything like this,\" describing the overwhelming infestation as an \"infinite sea of rats\" that is putting their livelihoods at risk.</p>\n<p>Over 100,000 acres of almond orchards are under siege from the nut-hungry rodents, which swarm trees and devour the valuable crop. The economic devastation is staggering, with initial estimates projecting more than $310 million in combined losses from destroyed crops and potential damage to vital infrastructure like irrigation systems.</p>\n<p>This is not a typical pest problem. The sheer scale of the infestation has taken the agricultural community by surprise. Professor Roger Baldwin, a rodent expert at the University of California-Davis, noted a massive spike in inquiries about rat issues, confirming the severity of the outbreak. Where he once received maybe one call a year, he is now inundated with requests for help from desperate farmers.</p>\n<p>The surge in the rat population is creating a dire situation for an industry that is a cornerstone of California's agriculture. As growers struggle to contain the damage, the crisis highlights the immense challenges farmers face from environmental shifts and unexpected natural events, with the financial and operational toll mounting daily.</p>\n","title":"An 'Infinite Sea of Rats': California's Almond Orchards Face a Devastating Rodent Siege","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-08-18T01:23:07Z","summary":"An unprecedented infestation of roof rats is devastating over 100,000 acres of almond orchards in Central California, with farmers facing over $310 million in projected losses from the rodent onslaught.","tags":["California","agriculture","almond farming","pest control","rat infestation","economy","environment"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/california-almond-orchards-under-siege-from-rats-never-seen-anything-like-this/ar-AA1KHfHe","title":"California almond orchards under siege from rats: 'Never seen anything like this'"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/food-and-drink/general/california-almond-farms-are-facing-a-310m-rat-problem/ar-AA1KtfCm","title":"California almond farms are facing a $310M rat problem"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/300m-in-losses-projected-for-california-as-almond-farms-overrun-with-nut-hungry-rats/ar-AA1Ke9jc","title":"$300M in losses projected for California as almond farms overrun with nut-hungry rats"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
