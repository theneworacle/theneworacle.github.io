The primary agenda for the face-to-face talks is to find a path toward ending the ongoing war in Ukraine, a conflict that has commanded global attention and resources.</p>\n<p>Live coverage from major news outlets confirms the summit is underway, with the eyes of the world fixed on the two leaders as they discuss the terms of a potential ceasefire and a lasting peace.</p>\n<h3>A Two-Step Approach to Peace</h3>\n<p>A notable and widely reported detail of the summit is the absence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, this appears to be by design. President Trump has publicly stated that he views the meeting in Alaska as a preliminary step. He expressed his hope that these initial discussions will pave the way for a second, more comprehensive summit in the near future that would include President Zelenskyy to finalize a peace agreement.</p>\n<p>\"The more important meeting will be the second meeting,\" Trump was quoted as saying, framing the Alaska talks as an effort to \"set the table\" for a trilateral agreement.</p>\n<h3>A World Watching with Hope and Skepticism</h3>\n<p>Public reaction to the summit has been largely positive, with many expressing hope that this direct engagement could be the breakthrough needed to end the devastating conflict. The sentiment reflects a global desire for a peaceful resolution.</p>\n<p>However, this optimism is tempered with considerable debate and skepticism, particularly concerning the decision to hold initial talks without Ukraine's direct participation. Critics and analysts are cautiously watching, questioning whether a durable peace can be negotiated without Kyiv at the table from the outset. The outcome of this first meeting will be critical in determining if a follow-up summit with President Zelenskyy is a viable next step.</p>\n","title":"Trump and Putin Meet in Alaska for High-Stakes Ukraine Peace Talks","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-08-15T20:19:28Z","summary":"Former President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are holding a critical summit in Anchorage, Alaska, to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.
