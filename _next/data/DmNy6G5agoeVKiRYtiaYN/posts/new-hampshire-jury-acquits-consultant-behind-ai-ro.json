{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"new-hampshire-jury-acquits-consultant-behind-ai-ro","contentHtml":"<p>In a closely watched case highlighting the burgeoning intersection of artificial intelligence and political campaigning, a New Hampshire jury has acquitted political consultant Steven Kramer on all charges related to AI-generated robocalls.</p>\n<p>Kramer was accused of orchestrating calls sent to thousands of New Hampshire Democrats just two days before the state's January 2024 presidential primary. The calls featured an AI-generated voice eerily similar to President Biden's, urging recipients to \"save your vote for the November election\" and implying that voting in the primary would prevent them from casting a ballot in the general election. Kramer faced charges of felony voter suppression and misdemeanor candidate impersonation, which could have resulted in decades in prison.</p>\n<p>However, Kramer admitted during the trial that he was behind the calls. He testified that his intent was not malicious voter suppression, but rather to serve as a \"wake-up call\" about the potential dangers and lack of regulation surrounding AI's use in political contexts. He stated he paid a magician $150 to create the recording after growing concerns about AI use in campaigns.</p>\n<p>His defense team argued that the state's voter suppression law didn't apply because the New Hampshire primary was not sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and Biden was not a formally declared candidate in that specific primary. They also contended that Kramer did not truly impersonate a candidate as the message did not explicitly name Biden. The jury's verdict suggests they were persuaded by these arguments.</p>\n<p>Despite the courtroom victory, Kramer's legal troubles are not entirely over. He still faces a proposed $6 million fine from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the calls, a penalty he has publicly stated he does not intend to pay. The company that transmitted the calls, Lingo Telecom, previously reached a $1 million settlement with the FCC.</p>\n<p>This case underscores the challenges regulators face in keeping pace with rapidly evolving AI technology and its potential impact on democratic processes. While many states are enacting legislation regarding AI deepfakes in campaigns, the federal regulatory landscape remains complex, with ongoing debates about the extent and nature of necessary rules.</p>\n","title":"New Hampshire jury acquits consultant behind AI robocalls mimicking Biden on all charges","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-13T20:23:52Z","summary":"A political consultant accused of sending AI-generated robocalls mimicking President Biden before the New Hampshire primary has been acquitted on all charges, raising questions about regulating AI in political campaigns.","tags":["AI","Politics","Robocalls","Election Integrity","New Hampshire","Regulation"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/13/metro/nh-robocalls-biden-court-case-acquitted/","title":"New Hampshire jury acquits consultant behind AI robocalls mimicking Biden on all charges"},{"url":"https://www.sfgate.com/news/politics/article/alert-consultant-behind-ai-robocalls-mimicking-20376407.php","title":"Consultant behind AI robocalls mimicking Biden acquitted of voter suppression, candidate impersonation in New Hampshire"},{"url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/consultant-ai-generated-robocalls-mimicking-biden-trial-new-122521107","title":"Consultant behind AI-generated robocalls mimicking Biden goes on trial in New Hampshire"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/company-that-sent-ai-calls-mimicking-joe-biden-to-new-hampshire-voters-agrees-to-pay-1-million-fine/ar-AA1pcA0t","title":"Company that sent AI calls mimicking Joe Biden to New Hampshire voters agrees to pay $1 million fine"},{"url":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/trial-begins-political-consultant-accused-sending-ai-generated-robocalls-mimicking-biden","title":"Trial begins for political consultant accused of sending AI-generated robocalls mimicking Biden"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
