However, despite this order, U.S. authorities placed him on a bus and sent him to Mexico. O.C.G. also reportedly feared returning to Mexico due to a past traumatic experience involving rape and extortion.</p>\n<p>A legal challenge followed, leading U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy to intervene. Judge Murphy found that the man's removal \"lacked any semblance of due process\" given the existing protection order. Consequently, the judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the United States.</p>\n<p>This case marks a notable instance where a federal court has successfully compelled the administration to reverse a deportation deemed unlawful due to due process violations. Reports indicate that the Trump administration ultimately complied with the order, admitting to a deportation error in this specific situation and working to bring O.C.G. back from Mexico.</p>\n<p>The return of O.C.G. underscores ongoing debates surrounding immigration enforcement, the importance of adhering to judicial orders, and the critical role of due process in the legal treatment of asylum seekers and migrants.</p>\n","title":"Deported Guatemalan Man Returns to US Following Court Order Against Trump Administration","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-05T08:21:59Z","summary":"A Guatemalan man who was deported by the Trump administration despite a standing immigration judge's protection order has been returned to the United States following a federal court mandate, highlighting due process concerns in immigration proceedings.","tags":["Immigration","Deportation","Due Process","Trump Administration","Court Order","Guatemala","Mexico","Asylum"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
