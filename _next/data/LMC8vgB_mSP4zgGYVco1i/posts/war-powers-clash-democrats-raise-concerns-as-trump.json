However, presidents have historically initiated military actions using their authority as Commander-in-Chief, particularly since the last formal declaration of war in WWII. This executive expansion of power led to the passage of the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires presidents to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and generally limits such actions to 60 days without congressional approval.</p>\n<p>Despite this resolution, the balance of power remains a point of contention. Recent presidents have often sought an \"Authorization for Use of Military Force\" (AUMF) from Congress as a modern alternative to a formal war declaration, but the scope and application of these authorizations have also been debated.</p>\n<p>Now, as the focus shifts to Iran, lawmakers are taking steps to assert their role. Bipartisan efforts are reportedly underway in both the House and Senate, with legislators like Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Tim Kaine introducing resolutions aimed at preventing offensive action against Iran unless explicitly authorized by Congress.</p>\n<p>The pushback from Congress is not just a procedural one; it reflects a deeper concern about the executive branch bypassing legislative authority on matters of war and peace. Critics point to previous instances where, they argue, the administration has encroached upon congressional prerogatives, including control over spending and trade policy.</p>\n<p>Public opinion also appears hesitant about military intervention in Iran. Recent polls suggest a majority of Americans, including a significant portion of those who voted for President Trump, oppose U.S. military involvement.</p>\n<p>The potential for U.S. action comes amidst reports of Israeli strikes targeting Iran's nuclear facilities. Some analysts suggest U.S. assistance might be required to effectively neutralize deeply buried sites, raising the stakes of any potential decision.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the situation highlights the enduring tension between the executive desire for swift action and the legislative mandate for deliberation and authorization when it comes to committing the nation to conflict. As President Trump weighs his options regarding Iran, the debate over who holds the authority to send American troops into harm's way is set to intensify on Capitol Hill.</p>\n","title":"War Powers Clash: Democrats Raise Concerns as Trump Considers Iran Strike","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-19T12:33:00Z","summary":"As President Trump reportedly mulls military action against Iran, Democrats and some bipartisan lawmakers are reigniting a debate over presidential war powers, asserting Congress's constitutional authority to authorize military force.","tags":["Trump","Iran","War Powers","Congress","Democrats","Foreign Policy","National Security"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democrats-raise-war-powers-concerns-as-trump-mulls-iran-strike/ar-AA1H1aEf","title":"Democrats raise war powers concerns as Trump mulls Iran strike"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/democrats-ambivalent-as-trump-prepares-to-launch-us-into-another-war/ar-AA1GZ659","title":"Democrats Ambivalent As Trump Prepares To Launch Us Into Another War"},{"url":"https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jun/18/congress-war-powers-iran-nuclear-strike/","title":"Does Donald Trump have sole power to decide if and when to strike Iran?
