While traditional research notes remain important, clients are increasingly seeking quick, digestible video summaries of market insights and analysis.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, UBS is utilizing advanced AI tools. They are reportedly using technologies like OpenAI to generate scripts based on their analysts' detailed research notes. These scripts are then brought to life by realistic AI avatars created using platforms such as Synthesia, which capture the likeness and voice of the actual analysts.</p>\n<p>The primary goal for UBS is efficiency and broader reach. By automating the video creation process, the bank can rapidly scale the production of video content, ensuring insights reach clients quickly and in their preferred format. This automation also aims to free up analysts' time, allowing them to concentrate on deeper research and more complex tasks rather than spending hours recording and editing videos.</p>\n<p>While the concept of AI avatars representing human professionals is still relatively new, initial simulated social sentiment suggests a mostly positive reaction to UBS's move, although, as with any significant AI deployment, some debate and discussion surrounding the technology are expected.</p>\n<p>This development highlights a growing trend across industries: using AI-powered video generation and avatars to enhance communication, meet evolving audience consumption habits, and increase operational efficiency in content creation.</p>\n","title":"UBS Bank Deploys AI Avatars of Analysts to Meet Client Demand for Video Content","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-23T09:20:58Z","summary":"Swiss banking giant UBS is leveraging artificial intelligence to create video avatars of its financial analysts, aiming to deliver investment insights in the short-form, video-centric formats clients now prefer.","tags":["AI","Finance","UBS","Artificial Intelligence","Banking","AI Avatars","Video Content","Synthesia","OpenAI"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
