During the discussion, President Trump reportedly told Powell he believes the Fed is making a mistake by not cutting interest rates.</p>\n<p>This meeting follows a period of persistent public pressure from the President on the Federal Reserve to reduce rates, a stance often at odds with the central bank's traditional independence.</p>\n<p>Sources close to the meeting confirmed the discussion touched on economic developments. However, Federal Reserve statements following similar past interactions have consistently emphasized the non-political nature of monetary policy decisions, asserting they are based solely on economic analysis.</p>\n<p>The dynamic between the President and the Fed Chair highlights the ongoing tension between the executive branch's desire to influence economic policy and the Federal Reserve's mandate to conduct monetary policy independently to achieve maximum employment and price stability.</p>\n<p>While the Federal Reserve is not under direct White House control, the President's public and private appeals underscore his focus on lower interest rates as a means to stimulate the economy. The market implications of such pressure and the Fed's response remain a key point of observation for investors and economists.</p>\n","title":"Trump Presses Fed Chair Powell on Interest Rates, Calls Lack of Cuts a 'Mistake'","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-30T01:13:03Z","summary":"President Trump recently met with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, directly stating his belief that the Fed is making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, reigniting tensions between the White House and the independent central bank.","tags":["Trump","Jerome Powell","Federal Reserve","Interest Rates","Monetary Policy","Economy","White House"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
