While some reports attribute the announcement to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), others specifically name Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as making the statement. Secretary Kennedy reportedly cited \"common sense\" and \"good science\" as the basis for the change.</p>\n<p>Despite the updated recommendations, health experts emphasize that millions of individuals, including those with a history of COVID-19 infection, may still be vulnerable to severe disease from the virus and could benefit from vaccination.
