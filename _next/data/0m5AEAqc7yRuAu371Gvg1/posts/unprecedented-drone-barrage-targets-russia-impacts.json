The barrages represent one of the most substantial drone assaults on Russian territory since the conflict began.</p>\n<p>Reports indicate that the sheer volume of incoming drones overwhelmed defenses in several areas. In Moscow, the attack led to disruptions, including temporary halts or delays to flights operating in and out of the capital's airports. While the full extent of the damage across all targeted regions remains unclear, the widespread nature of the assault signals an escalation in the use of drone technology in the ongoing conflict.</p>\n<p>The timing of these attacks has also been noted, with some reports connecting them to recent prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine. This adds another layer of complexity to the fluid situation.</p>\n<p>Reaction to the attacks on social media appears to be largely positive among those following the conflict, reflecting a sentiment that views the strikes as a significant development, though the topic is not without debate among different perspectives.</p>\n<p>The use of drones has been a defining characteristic of the modern battlefield, and this latest, large-scale attack on Russian soil underscores the evolving tactics and the increasing reach of such weapons.
