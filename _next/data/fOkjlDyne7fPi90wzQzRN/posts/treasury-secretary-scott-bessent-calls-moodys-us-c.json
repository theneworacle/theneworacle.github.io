Such actions by credit rating agencies can influence borrowing costs for the government, although the practical impact on U.S. Treasury yields is often debated due to the dollar's status as a global reserve currency.</p>\n<p>Secretary Bessent's remarks suggest a view that rating agencies' decisions often reflect past or current conditions rather than anticipating future improvements or the effects of current policy directions. He reportedly attributed the underlying fiscal concerns to federal spending during the previous administration.</p>\n<p>His comments also arrive amidst ongoing political discussions around fiscal policy, including debates surrounding potential tax legislation. Some analyses have linked the administration's fiscal stance and proposed policies to the broader context in which these credit rating decisions are made.</p>\n<p>The reaction to Bessent's statement and the downgrade itself has varied, with reports indicating a mix of support for the Treasury Secretary's optimistic view and continued debate over the nation's long-term fiscal stability. Social media sentiment, while broadly positive towards the administration's economic message, shows ongoing discussion on the topic.</p>\n<p>The exchange between the Treasury Secretary and the rating agency highlights the differing perspectives on the U.S. economic outlook and the role of external assessments in evaluating national fiscal health.</p>\n","title":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Calls Moody's US Credit Downgrade a 'Lagging Indicator'","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-18T20:13:05Z","summary":"Following Moody's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent characterized the move as a 'lagging indicator,' suggesting it doesn't reflect the current or future state of the economy under the current administration's policies.","tags":["Scott Bessent","Moody's","US Economy","Credit Rating","Treasury Department","Fiscal Policy","Debt"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
