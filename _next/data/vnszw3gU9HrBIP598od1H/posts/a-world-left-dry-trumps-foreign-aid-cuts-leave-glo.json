In Mali, the steel skeletons of water towers bake in the sun, never to be completed. These are not just abandoned construction sites; they are broken promises. A recent Reuters investigation has uncovered a stark reality: the Trump administration's sweeping decision to slash nearly all U.S. foreign aid has left at least 21 essential water and sanitation projects stalled across 16 countries, transforming symbols of hope into sources of hazard.</p>\n<h3>The Human Cost of Halted Projects</h3>\n<p>The consequences of these abandoned projects are not abstract. They are felt daily by millions of people who were counting on their completion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>In Kenya,</strong> what was once a solution is now a threat. Seventy-four-year-old farmer Mary Kibachia, whose home was recently inundated, now fears the unfinished canal will make future floods even worse. \"I have no protection from the flooding that the canal will now cause,\" she told reporters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>In Congo,</strong> unfinished water kiosks have become playgrounds. But the lack of safe, accessible water forces families to make dangerous journeys. “When we send young girls, they are raped. Young boys are kidnapped,” explained Evelyne Mbaswa, whose teenage son vanished while fetching water.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>In Nepal,</strong> work on over 100 drinking water systems has been suspended, leaving entire communities uncertain about their access to one of life's most basic necessities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>In Lebanon,</strong> a solar power initiative to energize water utilities was scrapped, eliminating jobs and forcing a reliance on expensive, polluting diesel generators.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A Ripple Effect of Risk</h3>\n<p>The damage extends beyond the immediate humanitarian crisis. A draft U.S. embassy memo from Kenya, cited in the investigation, warns that abandoning these projects poses a significant <strong>\"reputational risk\"</strong> for the United States. More alarmingly, it cautions this could morph into a <strong>\"security risk,\"</strong> potentially strengthening extremist groups like al Shabaab in regions where the U.S. has withdrawn its support.</p>\n<p>This pattern of defunding infrastructure is not limited to foreign aid. The administration has also pulled funding from domestic projects, including a crucial flood resilience program in North Carolina and California's high-speed rail initiative, suggesting a consistent policy approach.</p>\n<p>The policy is rooted in an \"America First\" ideology, which argues that taxpayer money should be spent at home. While this resonates with some, the on-the-ground reality reveals a world of unintended consequences, where the withdrawal of U.S. investment creates instability and new dangers that do not respect borders.</p>\n<p>As communities from Africa to Asia are left to salvage what they can, the message is clear: these cuts are more than just lines in a budget. They are lifelines for millions, and severing them has created new, preventable crises that may cost far more in the long run.</p>\n","title":"A World Left Dry: Trump's Foreign Aid Cuts Leave Global Water Projects—and Millions—in Peril","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-07-19T16:20:43Z","summary":"A sweeping cut to U.S. foreign aid under the Trump administration has abruptly halted dozens of vital water and sanitation projects across the globe.
