The goal is to harness the immense power of large-scale AI for national security. But another, quieter, and arguably more agile front is opening up in the military's AI strategy, led by veterans who have seen the challenges of modern warfare firsthand.</p>\n<p>Enter former Army officer Tyler Saltsman, founder of EdgeRunner AI. His startup is focused on a critical problem that mainstream, cloud-based AI can't solve: the need for intelligent systems that operate securely and effectively on the battlefield, completely disconnected from the internet.</p>\n<h3>The Problem with Plugged-in AI</h3>\n<p>For a warfighter in a remote or hostile environment, an internet connection is a liability, not a luxury. Commercial AI models, for all their power, require constant connectivity to function, making them impractical and insecure for frontline use. Furthermore, these models are trained on the vast, unfiltered internet, which can bake in geopolitical biases or other unpredictable behaviors that are unacceptable in a military context.</p>\n<p>\"The military cannot employ generic AI models that are biased against Israel and supportive of Hamas or Iran,\" Saltsman explained to FOX Business, highlighting the risks of using off-the-shelf AI for sensitive missions.</p>\n<h3>EdgeRunner's Solution: The 'Air-Gapped' AI Agent</h3>\n<p>EdgeRunner AI takes a different approach. The company builds specialized AI agents that are \"air-gapped\"—they run entirely on-device, with no need for an internet connection. This solves the dual problems of connectivity and security.</p>\n<p>Crucially, instead of training its models on Reddit threads and Wikipedia articles, EdgeRunner AI trains them on specific, classified military doctrine. The result is a highly specialized tool designed for the unique needs of a soldier. The company's flagship product, aptly named \"Battle Buddy,\" has already earned praise from the U.S. Space Force for its innovative approach.</p>\n<p>This focused strategy is gaining traction. The Department of Defense has designated EdgeRunner AI as an \"Awardable\" vendor, and the company has partnered with Second Front Systems to accelerate the deployment of its technology in the field.</p>\n<h3>A Dual-Track Future for Defense</h3>\n<p>The rise of EdgeRunner AI illustrates a sophisticated, two-pronged strategy for AI in defense. While the Pentagon leverages the raw power and scale of Big Tech for broad, strategic applications, it also recognizes the vital need for smaller, specialized firms to build tailored, secure solutions for the tactical edge. It’s a clear signal that the future of military AI won't be won by a single, all-powerful algorithm, but by a diverse ecosystem of tools built for specific, mission-critical purposes.</p>\n","title":"Boots on the Ground AI: How a Former Army Officer is Building Offline AI for the Front Lines","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-28T16:33:58Z","summary":"While the Pentagon awards massive contracts to tech giants like Google and OpenAI, a startup founded by a former Army officer is tackling a critical gap: building specialized, secure AI that works offline for soldiers in the field.","tags":["AI","Military Tech","Defense","Edge Computing","EdgeRunner AI","Pentagon","National Security"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/former-army-officer-develops-offline-ai-for-military-use-as-pentagon-funds-tech-giants/ar-AA1JrB9z","title":"Former Army officer develops offline AI for military use as Pentagon funds tech giants"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/pentagon-taps-four-commercial-tech-firms-to-expand-military-use-of-ai/ar-AA1IEHEu","title":"Pentagon taps four commercial tech firms to expand military use of AI"},{"url":"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2025-07-14/pentagon-200-million-contracts-ai-18441026.html","title":"Pentagon inks $200 million deals for use of leading AI models, including one behind Grok"},{"url":"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240807905056/en/Space-Force-Space-Systems-Command-Praises-EdgeRunner-AIs-Battle-Buddy-A-Revolutionary-Air-Gapped-Military-Support-System","title":"Space Force Space Systems Command Praises EdgeRunner AI's Battle Buddy A Revolutionary Air Gapped Military Support System"},{"url":"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250424387316/en/EdgeRunner-AI-Designated-Awardable-Vendor-for-Department-of-Defense-Chief-Digital-and-Artificial-Intelligence-Offices-Tradewinds-Solutions-Marketplace","title":"EdgeRunner AI Designated “Awardable” Vendor for Department of Defense Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office’s Tradewinds Solutions Marketplace"},{"url":"https://www.news-journal.com/second-front-systems-and-edgerunner-ai-forge-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-military-grade-ai-agents/article_8224a2aa-41f3-51e7-bf69-e180be53dd6e.html","title":"Second Front Systems and EdgeRunner AI Forge Strategic Partnership to Deploy Military-Grade AI Agents"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
