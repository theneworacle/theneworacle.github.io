{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"trump-terminates-trade-talks-with-canada-over-new-","contentHtml":"<p>In a swift move that escalates trade tensions, President Trump has declared the immediate termination of all trade talks with Canada. The decision stems directly from Canada's intention to implement a digital services tax targeting large technology companies, both foreign and domestic.</p>\n<p>President Trump took to social media to announce the halt in discussions, labeling Canada's planned tax as an \"egregious Tax\" and a \"blatant attack on our Country.\" This tax, which is set to take effect shortly, applies a 3% levy on revenue earned by large tech firms from online marketplace services, online advertising, social media services, and certain sales of user data, including streaming services.</p>\n<p>The President's announcement indicated that he would determine and impose new tariff rates on Canadian goods entering the United States within the next week. This development shatters any recent optimism surrounding potential trade agreements between the two neighboring nations.</p>\n<p>Multiple news outlets have corroborated the President's statement, confirming the digital services tax as the direct cause for the breakdown in negotiations. The tax is retroactive, potentially requiring U.S. companies to pay significant amounts to the Canadian government for past revenue.</p>\n<p>Initial reactions on social media show a mixed but leaning positive sentiment regarding the President's action, though debate on the implications of the trade halt is present.</p>\n","title":"Trump Terminates Trade Talks with Canada Over New Technology Tax","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-06-27T20:19:35Z","summary":"President Trump announced the immediate halt of trade discussions with Canada, citing the country's planned digital services tax on technology firms as a 'blatant attack' and 'egregious tax' on the U.S.","tags":["Trump","Canada","Trade Talks","Tariffs","Technology Tax","Digital Services Tax","US-Canada Relations"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-says-he-s-ending-trade-talks-with-canada-over-its-egregious-tax-on-technology-firms/ar-AA1HyCg5","title":"Trump says he's terminating trade talks with Canada over tax on technology firms"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/trump-says-hes-ending-trade-talks-with-canada-over-its-egregious-tax-on-technology-firms/ar-AA1HyI1j","title":"Trump says he's ending trade talks with Canada over its 'egregious Tax' on technology firms"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/trump-says-hes-terminating-all-discussions-on-trade-with-canada/ar-AA1Hyv7d","title":"Trump says he's \"terminating all discussions on trade with Canada, effective immediately\""},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-ca/politics/government/trump-cuts-off-us-trade-talks-with-canada-shattering-optimism-over-tariff-deals/ar-AA1HyTkg","title":"Trump cuts off US trade talks with Canada, shattering optimism over tariff deals"},{"url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/trump-says-u-s-has-ended-trade-talks-with-canada-242387525776","title":"Trump says U.S. has ended trade talks with Canada"},{"url":"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/trump-ends-canada-trade-talks-digital-services-streaming-tax-1236443014/","title":"Trump Says He’s Ending Canada Trade Talks Over Its 3% Digital Services and Streaming Tax: ‘Blatant Attack on Our Country’"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
