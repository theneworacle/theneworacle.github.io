This first-of-its-kind arrangement allows the American tech companies to gain access to the lucrative Chinese market by securing export licenses that were previously restricted.</p>\n<h3>Shifting from Bans to a Revenue-Share Model</h3>\n<p>This agreement marks a significant departure from the previous administration's policy, which focused on broad export bans to prevent China from acquiring advanced AI technologies, citing national security concerns. The new deal creates a novel framework that balances economic interests with national security, allowing U.S. companies to sell high-demand semiconductors, like Nvidia's H20 series, while the U.S. government takes a direct financial cut.</p>\n<p>In return for the 15% revenue share, the U.S. Commerce Department has begun issuing the necessary export licenses to both Nvidia and AMD, reopening a critical market that had been largely closed off.</p>\n<h3>A Pragmatic Deal Sparks Debate</h3>\n<p>The move has been met with a generally positive reaction, largely seen as a pragmatic solution that allows leading U.S. firms to remain competitive globally. However, the deal is not without its critics. The unprecedented nature of the government taking a direct revenue share from the sales of a private company has raised eyebrows and sparked debate.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, some experts question whether a financial arrangement can truly mitigate the national security risks that prompted the original export bans. The long-term implications of allowing advanced AI technology to be sold to China, even under these new terms, remain a subject of intense discussion among policymakers and industry analysts.</p>\n","title":"Nvidia, AMD to Give U.S. 15% Cut on AI Chip Sales to China","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-08-11T04:42:16Z","summary":"In a first-of-its-kind arrangement, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% share of revenues from their advanced AI chip sales to China in exchange for securing crucial export licenses, marking a significant pivot in U.S. trade policy.","tags":["Nvidia","AMD","AI","China","trade policy","semiconductors","US government","export controls"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/nvidia-amd-to-give-us-15-cut-on-ai-chip-sales-to-china/ar-AA1Kh5ot","title":"Nvidia, AMD to Give U.S. 15% Cut on AI Chip Sales to China"},{"url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgvvnx8y19o","title":"Chip giants Nvidia and AMD to pay 15% of China revenue to US"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
