Notably, Vice President JD Vance was expected to be among the attendees, highlighting the international significance of the occasion and the new Pope's American background.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the week, Pope Leo XIV had also celebrated Mass in the historic Sistine Chapel alongside the cardinals who elected him. During this earlier gathering, he delivered a message specifically directed at the priesthood, urging them to demonstrate humility in their service.</p>\n<p>These initial messages from Pope Leo XIV signal a pontificate focused on strengthening the Church from within through unity and humility, while simultaneously emphasizing its outward-looking mission to be a force for peace and reconciliation in the world.</p>\n<p>The call for a \"missionary spirit\" suggests a renewed focus on evangelization and reaching out to those both within and outside the traditional bounds of the Church. This, combined with the emphasis on unity, appears to be the foundational vision for Pope Leo XIV's time as the leader of the Catholic Church.</p>\n","title":"Pope Leo XIV Begins Pontificate Calling for Unity and Missionary Spirit","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-18T09:53:45Z","summary":"In his inaugural mass, Pope Leo XIV, the first American pontiff, emphasized the critical need for unity within the Catholic Church and urged a renewed 'missionary spirit' to make the church a global sign of peace.","tags":["Pope Leo XIV","Vatican","Catholic Church","Inaugural Mass","Unity","Missionary Spirit","Religion"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
