Critics argued the move would undermine civil service protections and consolidate executive power.</p>\n<p>The appeals court's decision leaves in place a lower court order issued by Judge Susan Illston. The court's reasoning centered on the argument that such widespread changes, including significant workforce reductions and agency reconfigurations, require explicit congressional approval, rather than solely relying on executive action. Questions were also raised regarding the overall legality and scope of the executive order driving the proposed overhaul.</p>\n<p>This ruling represents a setback for the administration's efforts to drastically alter the structure and size of the federal government. While the immediate impact is the continued block on the planned layoffs and restructuring, it underscores the legal constraints and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches when it comes to fundamental changes to the federal bureaucracy.</p>\n<p>Initial reactions online appear largely positive regarding the ruling, though there is ongoing debate concerning the necessity of the proposed government changes and the court's intervention.</p>\n","title":"Appeals Court Upholds Block on Trump's Sweeping Government Overhaul","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-31T08:19:47Z","summary":"A US appeals court has refused to lift a lower court's block on the Trump administration's plans for mass federal layoffs and agency restructuring, citing the need for congressional approval.","tags":["Trump Administration","Federal Government","Courts","Government Overhaul","US Politics","Federal Layoffs","Executive Order"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
