He declared the AI revolution to be <strong>\"as big or bigger\"</strong> than the internet, smartphones, or the app ecosystem. This is a monumental statement from the leader of a company that has defined the last two decades of consumer technology.</p>\n<p>Addressing employees, Cook didn't shy away from the fact that Apple is entering the generative AI arena later than competitors like Google and Microsoft. Instead, he framed it as a classic Apple strategy.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rarely been first,” Cook explained, citing a history of transformative, but not chronologically first, products. “There was a PC before the Mac; there was a smartphone before the iPhone; there were many tablets before the iPad; there was an MP3 player before iPod.”</p>\n<p>The message was unmistakable: Apple's goal isn't to be the first to the party, but to fundamentally redefine it. Cook argued that Apple succeeded by inventing the “modern” versions of those products. “This is how I feel about AI,” he stated, adding with a sense of urgency, <strong>“This is ours to grab.”</strong></p>\n<h3>Backing Up Talk with Billions</h3>\n<p>Cook's declaration is more than just a motivational speech. It's backed by a significant strategic pivot and massive investment. According to reports, Apple is funneling huge resources into AI, with 40% of its 12,000 new hires last year being dedicated to research and development.</p>\n<p>This push includes the development of new, specialized hardware to power the company's AI ambitions. A new cloud-computing chip, codenamed \"Baltra,\" is reportedly in the works, designed specifically to handle the intensive workloads required for advanced AI features.</p>\n<p>While the recently unveiled \"Apple Intelligence\" was a first step, Cook's comments signal a much deeper, more aggressive long-term plan. The company is investing in a “big way” and remains open to strategic acquisitions to accelerate its progress in the AI race.</p>\n<p>For a company known for its deliberate, often secretive, development cycles, this public and forceful internal push signifies a new era. Apple is placing its bet that a polished, intuitive, and seamlessly integrated AI experience will, once again, allow it to capture the market and define the future of technology.</p>\n","title":"Apple's AI Gambit: Tim Cook Declares AI 'Bigger Than the Internet'","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-08-03T16:29:08Z","summary":"Apple CEO Tim Cook has declared the AI revolution \"as big or bigger\" than the internet and smartphones, rallying employees with a familiar strategy: Apple may not be first, but it plans to win by inventing the \"modern\" version of AI.","tags":["Apple","Tim Cook","Artificial Intelligence","AI","Apple Intelligence","Tech Giants","Innovation"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-ceo-ai-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-the-internet-smartphones","title":"Apple CEO: AI Is 'As Big or Bigger' Than the Internet, Smartphones"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/technology/artificial-intelligence/tim-cook-tells-employees-that-the-ai-race-is-still-apple-s-to-lose-despite-setbacks/ar-AA1JMN4U","title":"Tim Cook Tells Employees That The AI Race Is Still Apple's To Lose, Despite Setbacks"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/tim-cook-reportedly-tells-employees-apple-must-win-in-ai/ar-AA1JNiqz","title":"Tim Cook reportedly tells employees Apple 'must' win in AI"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/apple-plans-to-significantly-grow-ai-investments-and-is-open-to-m-a/ar-AA1JFXYJ","title":"Apple plans to 'significantly' grow AI investments, Cook says"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
