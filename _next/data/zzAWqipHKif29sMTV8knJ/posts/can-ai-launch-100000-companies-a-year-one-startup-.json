According to a recent report, this studio has declared its intention to launch an astonishing 100,000 new companies every single year.</p>\n<p>To put that number in perspective, traditional startup studios or venture builders typically launch a handful to maybe a few dozen companies annually. The sheer scale of this new goal is unprecedented and speaks to a profound belief in AI's capacity to automate, streamline, and hyper-accelerate the company creation process.</p>\n<p>While the specific mechanisms and AI methodologies driving this ambitious target are not yet fully detailed in the available report, the announcement itself signals a potential paradigm shift.
