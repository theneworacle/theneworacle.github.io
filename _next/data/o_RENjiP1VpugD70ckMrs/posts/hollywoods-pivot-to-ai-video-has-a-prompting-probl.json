{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"hollywoods-pivot-to-ai-video-has-a-prompting-probl","contentHtml":"<p>The buzz around AI-generated video is everywhere, but for professional filmmakers, the reality falls short. The current crop of text-to-video AI models, often relying on simple text prompts, lack the nuanced control necessary for high-quality filmmaking. This \"prompting problem\" results in inconsistent and often unusable footage, contributing to the infamous \"uncanny valley.\"</p>\n<p>Filmmaker Bryn Mooser, co-founder of the production house Asteria, believes the tech industry has fundamentally misunderstood how AI should integrate with the creative process. Instead of viewing AI as a magic wand that conjures a full film from a prompt, Mooser envisions AI as a collaborative partner.</p>\n<p>Asteria is tackling the issue with an \"ethical\" approach, training its core generative model, Marey, exclusively on properly licensed material. This is a crucial distinction in an industry grappling with copyright concerns, highlighted by recent lawsuits like Disney and Universal against Midjourney.</p>\n<p>Technically, Asteria uses its core model to build project-specific models trained on original visual material provided by filmmakers. This method aims to give artists more control over the final aesthetic, allowing them to maintain their distinct style, although achieving true \"pixel-level\" control remains a challenge.</p>\n<p>The potential benefits are significant: Mooser suggests AI could drastically lower production costs, potentially enabling independent financing and allowing filmmakers to retain ownership of their work and even the AI models created for their projects. He sees AI as a tool for democratizing filmmaking, making it accessible to a broader range of creators.</p>\n<p>However, the path is not without its hurdles. The inherent limitations of current AI can lead to inconsistencies, requiring substantial human input and the director's \"human touch.\" Asteria's upcoming film, \"Uncanny Valley,\" even plans to lean into these visual quirks as an aesthetic feature, centering on a character whose perception of reality becomes video game-like.</p>\n<p>Job displacement is another valid concern, though Mooser suggests industry workers can adapt by transitioning into roles centered around generative AI. Despite these challenges, sentiment around this pivot and Asteria's approach appears cautiously optimistic, with a mix of enthusiasm and ongoing debate, reflecting the complex integration of AI into the creative heart of Hollywood.</p>\n","title":"Hollywood's pivot to AI video has a prompting problem","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-29T16:25:35Z","summary":"Current AI video models struggle with providing filmmakers the granular control needed for professional production, leading to a \"prompting problem.\" Production house Asteria aims to solve this by focusing on ethical data, collaborative AI, and giving artists more control to bridge the gap between AI potential and Hollywood's needs.","tags":["AI","Video","Filmmaking","Hollywood","Generative AI","Ethics","Copyright","Asteria","Bryn Mooser"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/694687/asteria-bryn-mooser-uncanny-valley-gen-ai","title":"Hollywood's pivot to AI video has a prompting problem"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
