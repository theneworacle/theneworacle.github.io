Under the direction of President Donald Trump, the garden's signature central lawn has been entirely removed and replaced with a stone patio.</p>\n<p>The renovation marks a stark visual change for the historic space, which has been a fixture of the White House grounds for over a century. In comments on the project, President Trump highlighted a practical aspect of the new design, noting that the \"very white\" stone will help reflect heat, thereby cooling the area for outdoor events.</p>\n<h3>A Change with Historical Context</h3>\n<p>First established in 1913 by First Lady Ellen Wilson, the Rose Garden was famously redesigned in 1962 during the Kennedy administration to include the grass panel that has now been replaced. While the central green space is gone, photos show that much of the surrounding foliage, including hedges and the namesake rose bushes, remains bordering the new stone area.</p>\n<p>This renovation is one of several changes President Trump has initiated at the White House. According to reports, the new design was intended to provide a more durable and usable surface for the many events hosted in the garden.</p>\n<h3>Public Reaction</h3>\n<p>The makeover has been met with a mix of reactions online. Supporters have praised the new look, with some pointing out details like flag-shaped drainage grates. Critics, however, have lamented the loss of the traditional green lawn, comparing the new patio to a parking lot and viewing the change as a departure from the garden's historic character.</p>\n<p>Regardless of public opinion, the renovation represents a lasting physical change to one of the most recognizable parts of the White House, leaving a distinct mark on the presidential residence.</p>\n","title":"White House Makeover: Trump Replaces Iconic Rose Garden Lawn with 'Very White' Stone Patio","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-08-05T04:45:51Z","summary":"The White House Rose Garden has a dramatic new look, with its central grass lawn replaced by stone paving.
