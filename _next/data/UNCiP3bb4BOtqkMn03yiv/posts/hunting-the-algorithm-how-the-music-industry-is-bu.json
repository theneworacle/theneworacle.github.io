{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"hunting-the-algorithm-how-the-music-industry-is-bu","contentHtml":"<p>The music industry faced a stark reality check in 2023 with the viral spread of convincingly fake AI-generated tracks. With no way to completely stem the tide of synthetic music, the industry is adopting a new strategy: building the infrastructure to hunt down, identify, and manage AI songs throughout the entire music pipeline.</p>\n<p>Instead of solely focusing on takedowns after a song goes viral, the focus is shifting to detection systems embedded across the creative workflow. From the tools used to train AI models to the platforms where music is uploaded and the databases that handle licensing, companies are working to identify synthetic content early, tag it with metadata, and control its flow through the system.</p>\n<p>A prime example of this proactive approach comes from the music streaming service Deezer. The company has rolled out an AI tagging system to increase transparency and combat fraudulent streams. Their internal AI detection tool has revealed a significant surge in AI-generated music, finding that 18% of songs uploaded daily are now fully AI-generated – a sharp increase from 10% just three months prior.</p>\n<p>While fully AI music currently represents a small fraction of overall streams (around 0.5% on Deezer), the motivation behind uploading many of these tracks appears questionable. Deezer suspects that up to 70% of the streams generated by these fully AI tracks are fraudulent, often stemming from bots designed to artificially inflate stream counts and collect royalties. In response, Deezer is actively using AI to detect these fraudulent patterns, effectively \"fighting AI with AI.\" They plan to label AI-generated content for users and exclude it from algorithmic and editorial recommendations to protect human artists and ensure fair compensation.</p>\n<p>This industry-wide challenge sparks concerns about the dilution of royalty pools and the impact on human creativity. Legal battles are already underway, with major labels filing copyright infringement lawsuits against AI song generators like Suno and Udio. Industry estimates, such as one from CISAC, project that AI could potentially \"cannibalize\" up to 24% of music creators' revenues by 2028.</p>\n<p>Building this new infrastructure is complex, requiring solutions for tracking provenance from training data to distribution and establishing standards like a \"Do Not Train Protocol\" (DNTP) to allow artists to opt out their work from model training. The social sentiment surrounding these developments is largely positive, reflecting support for protecting artists and combating fraud, though debates continue regarding the most effective and ethical path forward.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the music industry's response to AI is evolving rapidly, moving beyond reactive takedowns to build sophisticated technological frameworks designed to understand, manage, and potentially integrate AI-generated content in a way that respects copyright, ensures transparency, and sustains the ecosystem for human artists.</p>\n","title":"Hunting the Algorithm: How the Music Industry is Building Tech to Track AI Songs","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-21T12:40:12Z","summary":"As AI-generated music floods streaming platforms, the music industry is rapidly developing new technologies not just to block it, but to detect, track, and license it.
