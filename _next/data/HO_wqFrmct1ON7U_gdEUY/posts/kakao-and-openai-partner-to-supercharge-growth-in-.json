{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"kakao-and-openai-partner-to-supercharge-growth-in-","contentHtml":"<p>Korean internet giant Kakao, known for its ubiquitous KakaoTalk superapp used by 94% of South Korea's population, is making a bold strategic move to reignite growth: a deep partnership with OpenAI.</p>\n<p>The collaboration, announced in early 2025, aims to inject powerful artificial intelligence capabilities directly into Kakao's vast ecosystem of services, which spans messaging, banking, music, and transportation. Facing sluggish sales and fierce competition from rivals like Naver, Kakao is betting on AI to transform user experience and boost its core businesses like advertising and commerce.</p>\n<p>The strategy involves a hybrid approach, leveraging OpenAI's advanced large language models (LLMs) for complex tasks, while utilizing Kakao's own smaller, more cost-efficient, and secure small language models (SLMs) for simpler functions. This allows Kakao to develop sophisticated AI agents capable of performing multi-step actions for users – such as booking a restaurant, adding a calendar event, hailing a taxi, and processing payment – all within the KakaoTalk environment.</p>\n<p>For OpenAI, the partnership provides invaluable access to a highly tech-savvy market with a significant base of paying ChatGPT users outside the United States. This aligns with OpenAI's broader expansion strategy in Asia, including recent ventures in Japan.</p>\n<p>Kakao is backing this AI push with substantial infrastructure investment, including building new data centers. They have already launched a beta testing app called Kanana, featuring AI agents powered by both OpenAI and Kakao's models, with a wider rollout of AI agents in KakaoTalk targeted for November 2025. The company projects this AI integration could drive double-digit sales growth within two years.</p>\n<p>Initial social sentiment around the partnership appears largely positive, reflecting optimism about the potential for AI to enhance user experience in South Korea's most popular digital platform.</p>\n","title":"Kakao and OpenAI Partner to Supercharge Growth in South Korea's Digital Landscape","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-03T04:34:30Z","summary":"Korean internet giant Kakao is teaming up with OpenAI to integrate advanced AI capabilities into its dominant KakaoTalk superapp, aiming to deliver hyper-personalized services and drive significant growth in the South Korean market.","tags":["AI","OpenAI","Kakao","South Korea","Partnership","Technology","Superapp","KakaoTalk","Business Growth"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkang/2025/07/02/korean-internet-giant-kakao-teams-with-open-ai-to-jumpstart-growth/","title":"Korean Internet Giant Kakao Teams With Open AI To Jumpstart Growth"},{"url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2025/02/04/koreas-kakao-teams-up-with-openai-to-develop-ai-products/","title":"Korea's Kakao Teams Up With OpenAI To Develop AI Products"},{"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/openai-kakao-team-up-for-ai-products-talks-with-softbank-samsung-on-stargate/ar-AA1ynJHf","title":"OpenAI, Kakao team up for AI products; talks with SoftBank, Samsung on Stargate"},{"url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/openai-doubles-down-on-asia-partners-with-kakao-after-its-big-deal-with-softbank/","title":"OpenAI partners with Korea's Kakao after inking SoftBank Japanese JV"},{"url":"https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/2025020312253/openai-to-jointly-develop-ai-products-with-south-korean-tech-giant-kakao","title":"OpenAI to Jointly Develop AI Products With South Korean Tech Giant Kakao"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
