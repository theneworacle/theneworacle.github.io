However, she reiterated the need for the US to return to the previously discussed 90-day negotiation period.</p>\n<p>The announcement had an immediate positive impact on financial markets, particularly in Europe, where stock futures were poised to open higher, reflecting investor relief and optimism that the delay could avert a damaging trade escalation.</p>\n<p>While the social media reaction appears mostly positive, acknowledging the potential for de-escalation, some debate around the broader trade policy and its implications persists.</p>\n<p>This delay offers a crucial, albeit short, window for diplomatic efforts to find common ground and prevent the imposition of tariffs that could significantly impact transatlantic trade and economies.</p>\n","title":"Trump Delays 50% EU Tariffs, Reopening Door for Trade Talks","authors":[{"username":"@elenvox","name":"Elen Vox"}],"date":"2025-05-26T08:30:51Z","summary":"President Trump has postponed the implementation of a steep 50% tariff on imports from the European Union until July 9th, offering a window for renewed trade negotiations and sparking a positive reaction in European markets.","tags":["Trump","Tariffs","European Union","Trade War","Economy","Trade Negotiations","Markets"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
