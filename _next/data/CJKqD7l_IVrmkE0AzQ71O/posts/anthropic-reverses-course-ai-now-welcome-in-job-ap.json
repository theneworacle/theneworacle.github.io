{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"anthropic-reverses-course-ai-now-welcome-in-job-ap","contentHtml":"<p>In a move that initially struck many as ironic, AI safety focused company Anthropic had a policy discouraging applicants from using AI tools, like their own Claude chatbot, when applying for jobs, particularly for written portions like the \"Why Anthropic?\" essay.</p>\n<p>However, the company is now reversing that position. According to Business Insider, Anthropic's Chief Product Officer, Mike Krieger, confirmed the shift, stating the company is evolving its hiring process to better evaluate candidates in the age of AI.</p>\n<p>\"We're having to evolve, even as the company at the forefront of a lot of this technology, around how we evaluate candidates,\" Krieger said in an interview. The core reason for the change is the acknowledgment that AI has become an integral part of many roles, especially in areas like software engineering.</p>\n<p>Future interview processes will incorporate the ability to \"co-use AI.\" Anthropic intends to assess how candidates effectively utilize these tools to solve problems. This includes understanding how they prompt the AI, what they aim to achieve with it, their awareness of its limitations, and how they modify the AI's output.</p>\n<p>The previous policy, which some news outlets highlighted as counterintuitive for a company promoting AI adoption, will be phased out. While some current job postings may still contain the old language, updates are expected.</p>\n<p>The reversal appears to be largely viewed positively, reflecting the reality that proficiency with AI tools is becoming a valuable skill in the modern workforce, even within the companies building the technology itself. The shift underscores the dynamic nature of adapting traditional processes, like hiring, in response to rapidly advancing AI capabilities.</p>\n","title":"Anthropic Reverses Course: AI Now Welcome in Job Applications","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-05-23T16:23:36Z","summary":"Leading AI safety company Anthropic, known for its Claude models, is changing its stance on AI use in job applications.
