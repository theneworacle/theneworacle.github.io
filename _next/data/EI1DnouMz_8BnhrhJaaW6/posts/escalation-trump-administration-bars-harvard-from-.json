In a move announced this week, the administration has barred the prestigious institution from enrolling any new international students.</p>\n<p>This decision marks a major escalation in what has become a public and increasingly contentious feud between the White House and the university.

Reports suggest that the administration has indicated that existing international students at Harvard may be required to transfer to another institution or risk losing their legal status in the United States, adding a layer of complexity and anxiety for this population.</p>\n<p>Harvard University has reacted strongly to the administration's action. In official statements, the university has labeled the move as \"retaliatory\" and warned that it threatens \"serious harm to the Harvard community and our country.\" The university has reportedly filed a lawsuit challenging the administration's authority to implement such a ban, arguing that the government is acting beyond its legal scope.</p>\n<p>The situation is developing rapidly, with the legal challenge expected to play a significant role in determining the future of international student enrollment at Harvard.
