He worked with acclaimed directors like Federico Fellini (\"Toby Dammit\") and Steven Soderbergh, who directed him in the critically acclaimed thriller \"The Limey\" (1999), a role many consider among his finest. His other notable films include \"The Collector,\" \"Far from the Madding Crowd,\" and \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"</p>\n<h2>A Lasting Legacy</h2>\n<p>News of his passing led to a wave of appreciation across social media, with many sharing clips of his performances and celebrating his unique on-screen presence.
