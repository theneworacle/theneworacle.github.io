While acknowledging AI's significance, he offered a tempered outlook on its overall impact on technological progress.</p>\n<p>Speaking on The New York Times' \"Interesting Times\" podcast, Thiel described AI as \"more than a nothing burger\" and comparable in transformative potential to the internet of the late 1990s. However, he notably added that it is \"less than the total transformation of our society.\"</p>\n<p>Thiel reiterated his long-held belief, first articulated in a 2011 essay, that technological progress in areas like energy and transportation has largely stagnated since the 1970s, despite rapid advancements in computing. He contends that without AI, the tech landscape would face \"total stagnation.\"</p>\n<p>Despite investing in major AI players like OpenAI, Palantir, and DeepMind, Thiel remains unconvinced that AI alone is enough to fundamentally end this broader stagnation. He believes AI \"might be enough to create some great companies\" and contribute to GDP, but questioned its capacity to truly reverse the trend.</p>\n<p>To break the cycle of stagnation, Thiel advocates for greater risk-taking in ambitious endeavors outside of AI, such as space exploration and medical breakthroughs like curing dementia. He stressed the importance of finding a \"way back to the future,\" warning that without such efforts, society could \"unravel.\"</p>\n<p>Thiel's comments spark debate within the tech community and beyond, prompting discussions about the true scope of the AI revolution and the potential for progress in other critical sectors. While social sentiment surrounding his views appears mostly positive, the discussion around whether AI can truly cure technological stagnation is far from settled.</p>\n","title":"Peter Thiel: AI is Big, But Won't Cure Tech Stagnation","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-06-27T12:44:59Z","summary":"Billionaire investor Peter Thiel weighs in on the AI revolution, calling it transformative but questioning its ability to end a broader stagnation in technological progress outside of computing.","tags":["AI","Peter Thiel","Technology","Innovation","Stagnation","Investing"],"sources":[{"url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-ai-tech-stagnation-2025-6","title":"AI isn't 'a nothing burger,' but won't end 'stagnation' in tech, says Peter Thiel"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
