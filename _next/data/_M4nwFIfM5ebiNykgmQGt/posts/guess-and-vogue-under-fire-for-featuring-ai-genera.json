A new advertising campaign from clothing giant Guess, published in the August 2025 issue of <em>Vogue</em>, has swapped human models for artificially generated counterparts, and the industry is deeply divided.</p>\n<p>The ads feature two stunningly realistic virtual models known as Vivienne and Anastasia, created by the London-based AI marketing agency Seraphinne Vallora. The campaign immediately went viral, sparking a backlash on social media platforms like TikTok, where users questioned the decision to replace iconic human faces with digital creations.</p>\n<h3>The Backlash: Jobs, Beauty Standards, and Brand Identity</h3>\n<p>Critics have been quick to voice their concerns, which fall into several key areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> Many fear this signals a bleak future for human models, photographers, stylists, and others involved in traditional photoshoots. As one TikTok user put it, \"all of these models are going to be out of work, all of these photographers are going to be out of work.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Unrealistic Beauty Standards:</strong> The fashion industry has long been criticized for promoting unattainable ideals of beauty. Psychologists warn that using flawless, non-existent AI models can normalize these impossible standards, leading to feelings of inadequacy and poor self-image among consumers.</li>\n<li><strong>Forgetting a Legacy:</strong> Some feel Guess has abandoned its iconic brand identity, which was built on legendary campaigns with superstar models like Drew Barrymore, Eva Mendes, and Claudia Schiffer. \"This doesn't make me want to buy anything,\" one fashion-focused creator commented, lamenting the loss of the brand's 'bombshell' legacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A New Marketing Frontier?</h3>\n<p>Despite the controversy, the creators of the AI models are defending their work. Seraphinne Vallora's co-founders insist they aren't trying to replace the modeling industry but rather to \"co-exist\" with it. They position their service as a supplementary marketing tool, a \"new avenue\" for creating the kind of beautiful, surreal imagery that resonates with audiences.</p>\n<p>In a statement to \"Good Morning America,\" co-founder Valentina Gonzalez said, \"What do people respond to? Beautiful women, things that look surreal, things that are very stunning. And when we get this backlash, we're like, well, that's what you responded to.\"</p>\n<p><em>Vogue</em>'s parent company, Condé Nast, clarified that an AI model has never appeared in the magazine's editorial content, drawing a line between advertising and its own curated features.</p>\n<p>The Guess campaign serves as a stark example of AI's disruptive entry into the creative and advertising industries. It forces us to confront difficult questions about the value we place on human creativity, the ethics of digital representation, and the kind of beauty we choose to celebrate. As technology continues to blur the lines between real and artificial, this debate is only just beginning.</p>\n","title":"Guess and Vogue Under Fire for Featuring AI-Generated Models in New Ad Campaign","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-08-01T16:36:31Z","summary":"Guess's latest ad campaign, featured in Vogue magazine, has ignited a firestorm of controversy by using hyper-realistic, AI-generated models.
