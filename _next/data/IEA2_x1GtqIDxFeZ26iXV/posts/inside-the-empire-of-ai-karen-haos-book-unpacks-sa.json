The excerpt details early meetings where the two tech titans discussed the trajectory of AI and its potential impact on humanity. While Altman, then head of Y Combinator, impressed Musk with his strategic vision and apparent alignment on AI safety, Musk harbored deep-seated concerns about AI's existential threats – famously describing its development as \"summoning the demon.\"</p>\n<p>This philosophical divide is a central theme, illustrating the early tension between accelerating AI capabilities and ensuring safety.
