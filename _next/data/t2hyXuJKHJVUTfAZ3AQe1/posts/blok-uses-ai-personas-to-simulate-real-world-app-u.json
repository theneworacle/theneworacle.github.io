Traditional methods often rely on shipping beta versions or reactive A/B testing, which can be time-consuming and risky. A new company, Blok, is stepping into this space with an innovative approach: using AI personas to simulate real-world app usage.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2024 by serial entrepreneurs Tom Charman and Olivia Higgs, Blok aims to provide a proactive solution to app testing. Recognizing the increasing complexity of modern interfaces, especially with the rise of chat and voice interactions, Blok's platform allows developers to test features against a diverse range of AI-driven user simulations.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works: Customers upload their existing event log data from analytics platforms like Amplitude, Mixpanel, or Segment. Blok uses this data to perform behavioral modeling and create a suite of AI personas that represent the app's typical user base. Developers then provide Figma designs and details about the experiment or feature they want to test â€“ including the hypothesis and user goal. Blok's AI agents run extensive simulations based on how the created personas would interact with the proposed feature.</p>\n<p>The outcome is a detailed report offering insights and recommendations <em>before</em> the feature is coded or released. This includes an overall experiment summary, details on what worked well or needs improvement, and persona-specific feedback. A conversational chatbot is also available for developers to query about the simulation results.</p>\n<p>Blok has already raised $7.5 million across two funding rounds, with investment from notable firms and individuals across the tech landscape. Investors see Blok as offering a predictive layer that goes beyond existing reactive tools like Optimizely and Amplitude.</p>\n<p>Currently, Blok is operating on a waitlist and working with initial customers, focusing on industries like finance and healthcare where rigorous, pre-launch testing is paramount. The company operates on a SaaS model and is balancing compute costs as it aims for significant revenue targets this year.</p>\n<p>While the concept of AI personas is being explored in various fields, Blok's application in simulating app behavior for predictive testing marks a significant step forward in the product development lifecycle, potentially saving companies time and resources by catching issues before they impact real users.</p>\n","title":"Blok Uses AI Personas to Simulate Real-World App Usage, Revolutionizing Testing","authors":[{"username":"@alanaturner","name":"Alana Turner"}],"date":"2025-07-09T16:27:29Z","summary":"Emerging from stealth, Blok is leveraging AI-powered personas to simulate diverse user interactions, offering app developers a predictive testing layer that could significantly reduce the need for extensive post-launch A/B testing.","tags":["AI","Startups","App Development","Software Testing","Simulation","AI Personas"],"sources":[{"url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/blok-is-using-ai-persons-to-simulate-real-world-app-usage/","title":"Blok is using AI personas to simulate real-world app usage"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
